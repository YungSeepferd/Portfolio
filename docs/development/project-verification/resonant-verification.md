# Resonant Relaxation Content Verification

Last updated: September 30, 2025

## Scope

Verify `src/components/work/data/projects/resonantRelaxation.js` against:

- `src/assets/information/Procedually generated haptics/ResonantRelaxation_Presentation.pdf`
- `src/assets/information/Procedually generated haptics/EuroHaptics_2024_Final_WIP_1077.pdf`
- `src/assets/information/Procedually generated haptics/POSTER_Resonant Relaxation - Eurohaptics 24.pdf`

## File under review

- `src/components/work/data/projects/resonantRelaxation.js`

## Claims to verify

- **Framing & partners**
  - [ ] EuroHaptics 2024 presentation and Innovobot Labs collaboration (lines 72–77)

- **Methodology**
  - [ ] Two-part audio‑haptic concept: baseline + AI‑generated sparkles (lines 144–152)
  - [ ] User testing setup (voice‑coil actuators) (line 155)

- **Technical**
  - [ ] Real‑time React‑based web app; GPT‑4 integration; audio (Tone.js) and parameterization (lines 171–189)

- **Evaluation & outcomes**
  - [ ] Combined audio‑haptic vs single‑modality result and 37% improvement statement (lines 203–205)
  - [ ] Takeaways list (lines 211–217)
  - [ ] Outcomes points (lines 218–224)

- **Links**
  - [ ] Presentation, paper, poster links render and open.

## Language consistency

- [ ] Hyphenation (audio‑haptic, AI‑generated, real‑time, web‑based)

## Proposed edits (post‑verification)

- Keep schema and media unchanged; adjust copy only if PDFs/poster differ.

## Acceptance checklist

- [ ] Items verified against presentation + paper + poster
- [ ] `resonantRelaxation.js` updated where necessary
- [ ] Build passes
- [ ] Modal renders correctly (optional E2E)

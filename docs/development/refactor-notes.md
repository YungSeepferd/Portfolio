# Refactor Notes

Last Updated: October 1, 2025

## Scope
- Target: `src/components/work/ProjectSectionRenderer.js`
- Goal: Improve readability of the Work modal section rendering pipeline without changing behaviour.
- Tests: Add unit coverage for the section pipeline (normalizer + analyzer) and an E2E check for modal sections (Gallery + Timeline) on Master Thesis.

## Why this file
- Central router for section rendering pipeline (`normalizeSection` → `analyzeSectionContent` → renderer selection).
- High-traffic path in the Work modal; small clarity wins reduce future bug risk.

## Changes (no behaviour change)
- Extracted repeated props per iteration:
  - Computed `key`, `id`, `title`, `content` once and reused across branches.
  - Kept all prop values and branching intact.
- Passed `projectColor` consistently (already present for most branches; unchanged logic).

### File diffs
- `src/components/work/ProjectSectionRenderer.js`
  - Reused `key`, `id`, `title`, `content` in branches for `TimelineSection`, `StepperSection`, `CardGridSection`, `AccordionSection`, `GallerySection`, and fallback `ProjectSection`.

## Tests
- Unit (Jest via CRA): `src/utils/__tests__/sectionPipeline.test.js`
  - Verifies gallery arrays normalize to a collection and are classified as `gallery`.
  - Confirms `metadata.originalType` persists for `timeline` sections and analyzer returns a valid strategy.
  - Checks text-only content analysis returns a reasonable layout hint.
- E2E (Selenium): `tests/e2e/modal-section-pipeline.test.js`
  - Opens the first project (Master Thesis) from Work.
  - Asserts presence of `#section-gallery` with images.
  - Asserts presence of `#section-methodology` (Timeline) and attempts to detect `.MuiTimeline-root`.

## How to run
- Unit tests (Jest):
  ```bash
  npm test -- --watch=false --passWithNoTests
  ```
- Build (ensure no bundler errors):
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
- E2E (requires dev server):
  ```bash
  npm start    # in one terminal
  HEADLESS=true node tests/e2e/modal-section-pipeline.test.js    # in a second terminal
  ```
  - Set `HEADLESS=false` to observe the browser.

## Follow-ups
- Consider normalizing `sectionNumber` passing across all branches (some already rely on `sectionIndex` fallback; acceptable but could be made explicit for consistency).
- Optional: add an npm script alias for the new E2E test.
- Consider consolidating section heading rendering (eyebrow + title) into a shared helper to reduce duplication across section components.

# PDF Alignment Corrections

_Date: October 1, 2025, 00:51 CET_

## Overview

All project content adjusted to match PDF source materials as the **single source of truth**. Removed or corrected any claims not explicitly found in extracted PDFs.

---

## Corrections Made

### 1. Bachelor Thesis ✅ CORRECTED

**Timing Data - NOW ACCURATE**

**Before** (Inaccurate phrasing):
```
Fast Thinking participants completed tasks quicker (average 51 seconds) than 
Slow Thinking participants (average 68 seconds)
```

**After** (From PDF - PassengerReroute_Thesis.txt):
```
Fast Thinking group completed tasks faster (Mean 00:51) than Slow Thinking 
group (Mean 01:08), with overall mean of 01:00 across all 30 participants
```

**Source Evidence**:
```
FT123 Mean = 00:51 ; ST123 Mean = 01:08; [n=30] Mean = 01:00
```

**File**: `src/components/work/data/projects/bachelorThesis.js`  
**Line**: 330

---

### 2. Resonant Relaxation ✅ CORRECTED

**37% Claim - REMOVED (Not in PDFs)**

**Before**:
```
Self reported relaxation scores increased 37% with the combined system 
versus audio only controls
```

**After**:
```
[Removed - not found in any extracted PDF section]
```

**Rationale**: Systematic search of all Resonant Relaxation PDFs found no mention of "37%" or specific percentage improvements. Only qualitative findings were documented:
- "Participants reported increased feelings of calm"
- "preferred a variety of sparkles"
- Enhanced perceived relaxation

**File**: `src/components/work/data/projects/resonantRelaxation.js`  
**Lines**: 272-277 (revised to 4 findings instead of 5)

---

### 3. Green Wallet ✅ CORRECTED

**"First Place" Claim - REMOVED (Not Verified in PDFs)**

**Before**:
```
outcomes: {
  title: "Project Achievements",
  points: [
    "First place in the Tourism Technology Festival 2023 Hackathon",
    "Solution recommended for pilot implementation by Mastercard",
    "Positive reception from local tourism stakeholders"
  ]
}
```

**After** (PDF-Verified Only):
```
outcomes: {
  title: "Project Achievements",
  points: [
    "Competed in the Tourism Technology Festival 2023 Hackathon (November 11, 2023)",
    "Developed solution addressing Mastercard's challenge track",
    "Created gamified concept connecting sustainability with tourism economics"
  ]
}
```

**Rationale**: PDFs mention "prizes" and "winners" but do not specify Green Wallet's placement. Only verifiable facts retained:
- ✅ Date: November 11, 2023 (from 02.pdf)
- ✅ Mastercard challenge (from Script.pdf, 02.pdf)
- ✅ Tourism Technology Festival 2023 (from 02.pdf: "TTF2023")

**File**: `src/components/work/data/projects/greenWallet.js`  
**Lines**: 320-327

## Detailed Evidence Trail

### Bachelor Thesis - Timing Data
**PDF Source**: `PassengerReroute_Thesis.txt`

**Exact Quote**:
```
The FT group finished the task of rerouting faster (FT123 Mean = 30.78, 
StdDev = 20.133; ST123 Mean = 50.56, StdDev: 81.457; [n=30] Mean = 40.67, 
StdDev = 59.830).

...

The group FT tended to finish the tasks more quickly than ST (FT123 Mean = 
00:51 ; ST123 Mean = 01:08; [n=30] Mean = 01:00.
```

**Interpretation**:
- FT (Fast Thinking): Mean 00:51 (51 seconds)
- ST (Slow Thinking): Mean 01:08 (68 seconds / 1 minute 8 seconds)
- Overall mean: 01:00 (60 seconds)

**Search Patterns**:
```bash
grep -i "37\|percent\|%"
grep -i "relax.*score\|improvement\|increase"
grep -i "baseline.*control\|audio.*only"
```

**Result**: No matches for 37% or specific quantitative improvement

3. ✅ Verify numbers match exactly
4. ✅ Don't infer achievements not explicitly stated

### Documentation Practice
1. Keep extracted PDFs as reference
2. Note which PDF contains each claim
3. Update this document when adding new content
4. Re-run verification after any content changes

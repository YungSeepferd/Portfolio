# Project Modal Content Modernization

**Date:** September 30, 2025  
**Task:** Modernize project modal section content across all 6 portfolio projects

## Overview

Systematically improved content quality across all project modals to enhance clarity, professionalism, and accessibility while maintaining technical accuracy.

## Goals Achieved

### Content Quality Improvements
- **Clarity:** Removed vague qualifiers ("significantly", "effectively", "various") without specific context
- **Conciseness:** Reduced verbose descriptions while preserving key information
- **Professional accessibility:** Expert tone that remains understandable for non-technical readers
- **Factual accuracy:** Verified technical claims and removed unsubstantiated assertions
- **Consistency:** Applied uniform writing style across all projects

### Style Guidelines Applied
- Eliminated hyphens in content per AGENTS.md guidance (e.g., "user-centered" → "user centered")
- Replaced compound adjectives with clearer alternatives
- Used active voice and direct statements
- Structured bullet points with bold labels for better scanning
- Added lead paragraphs to improve content hierarchy

**Example Improvements:**
- Before: "developed MVP was a robust React-based web application, featuring real-time, procedurally generated..."
- After: "The MVP is a React based web application featuring real time, procedurally generated audio haptic content:"

## Content Patterns Applied

### Typography Hierarchy
- Lead paragraphs introduce each section
- Bullet points use bold labels for quick scanning
- Lists maintain consistent formatting

### Professional Tone
- Removed marketing language ("innovative", "cutting-edge" without context)
- Kept technical accuracy while improving readability
- Maintained expert voice without jargon

### Structural Consistency
- Problem statements with labeled bullet points
- Methodology sections with clear phases
- Outcomes with specific metrics where available

## Technical Considerations

### No Breaking Changes
- Preserved all data structures and schemas
- Maintained existing component contracts
- No changes to media references or navigation anchors
- All React components and JSX structure intact

### Future Compatibility
- Content updates work seamlessly with existing renderers:
  - `ProjectSection.js` for standard sections
  - `GallerySection.js` for image collections
  - `ProcessSection.js` for step-based content
- Content pipeline (`sectionNormalizer` → `sectionAnalyzer`) handles updated content without modifications

## Testing Recommendations

### Build Verification
```bash
npm run build
```
Expected: Clean build with no errors

### Development Server
```bash
npm start
```
Expected: All projects render correctly in modals

### Modal Navigation
1. Open each project from work section
2. Navigate through sections using scroll or tabs
3. Verify content renders properly at all breakpoints
4. Test modal navigation (prev/next project buttons)

### Smoke Tests
```bash
npm run test:e2e
```
Expected: All E2E tests pass (requires running dev server)

## Files Modified

1. `src/components/work/data/projects/adhdeer.js` - 13 content edits
2. `src/components/work/data/projects/amiai.js` - 11 content edits
3. `src/components/work/data/projects/bachelorThesis.js` - 14 content edits

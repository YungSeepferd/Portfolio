# Content Quality Polish: Hyphen Audit & Professional Tone

_Completed: October 1, 2025, 00:28 CET_

## Overview

Systematic content quality improvement across all 6 portfolio projects following AGENTS.md guideline: **"Do not use '-' in content writing"**. This polish ensures professional tone while maintaining accessibility for layman audiences.

---

## Methodology

### 1. Comprehensive Hyphen Scan

Used grep to identify all hyphenated terms in project content:
```bash
grep -oE "[a-z]+-[a-z]+" src/components/work/data/projects/*.js
```

### 2. Categorization

**Content Hyphens (FIXED)**:
- Compound adjectives: audio-haptic, real-time, hands-on
- Technical terms: web-based, browser-based, React-based
- Descriptive phrases: user-centered, decision-making, eco-friendly
- Time references: long-term, time-intensive, time-consuming
- Modality terms: multi-sensory, single-modality, audio-only
- Positional terms: on-body, rear-seat, non-critical

**Code Identifiers (KEPT)**:
- node-id, section-, anchor- (technical identifiers)
- URL parameters and paths

### 3. Replacement Strategy

- **Compound adjectives** → Space-separated: "audio-haptic" → "audio haptic"
- **Prefixed terms** → Single word or spaced: "multi-sensory" → "multisensory"
- **Time references** → Spaced: "real-time" → "real time"
- **Professional tone** → Maintained throughout

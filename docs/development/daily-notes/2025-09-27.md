# Daily Dev Loop â€” 2025-09-27

Goal: Implement a small, end-to-end change in the Work section with minimal diffs and no new dependencies.

## Five-bullet plan

- Implement a minimal `TechBar` wrapper component in `src/components/work/TechBar.js` that composes `TechnologyTags` to standardize technology chip rendering (aligns with `docs/development/next-steps.md`).
- Keep styling token-driven via the theme and reuse `TechnologyTags` logic; avoid introducing new styles or props.
- Verify usage points: `ProjectCardPreview.js`, `ProjectMetaBar.js`, and `ProjectFullContent.js` to ensure compatibility and no regressions (no imports will be changed today).
- Run local checks: dev server, production build, and smoke test to ensure no console/runtime issues and stable UX.
- Document the change and acceptance checklist below; capture any follow-ups if issues appear.

## Files to touch today

- `src/components/work/TechBar.js` (new)
- `docs/development/daily-notes/2025-09-27.md` (this file)

## Acceptance checklist (to confirm after implementation/testing)
- [ ] Dev server starts cleanly with no errors/warnings related to the change.
- [x] Production build succeeds: `npm run build`.
- [ ] Smoke test passes: `npm run test:e2e` (with dev server running).
- [ ] Work section remains responsive on mobile/desktop and in dark/light themes.
- [ ] No console noise in production paths and no new dependencies introduced.

## What changed / Next steps

- Change: Added a minimal `TechBar` wrapper component delegating to `TechnologyTags` to align with docs and provide a stable import point for future integrations.
- Tests run: Build succeeded. Dev server and smoke E2E pending.
- Next steps: Re-run smoke E2E (overlay fix added). If all green, optionally adopt `TechBar` where semantically appropriate.

# Daily Dev Notes: October 1, 2025

## Workflows Executed
- `/docsandlinkssweep` - Documentation validation and updates
- `/dailydevloop` - Content quality improvement

## Plan

1. **Documentation Sweep** ✓
   - Validate all official documentation links (React Three Fiber, Framer Motion, MUI)
   - Update `docs/resources/links.md` with current status
   - Verify all dependencies are documented

2. **Content Quality Fix** (In Progress)
   - Fix duplicate paragraph in `amiai.js` (lines 77-82)
   - Identified in fact-check report as minor duplication issue

3. **Testing**
   - Run `npm run build` to verify no regressions
   - Dev server smoke test

4. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update fact-check report with fix status
   - Update this notes file with outcomes

## Implementation Notes

### Documentation Sweep Results

**Links Validated** ✓
- React Three Fiber docs: https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction (current)
- Framer Motion docs: https://www.framer.com/motion/introduction/ (current)
- MUI docs: https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/theming/ (current)

**Updates Made**:
- Added React PDF section to `links.md` (not currently used, but documented for future)
- Updated "Last Updated" date to October 1, 2025
- All dependency statuses verified against `package.json`

**Findings**:
- All documentation is in excellent shape from Sept 30 sweep
- No broken links found
- All current dependencies properly documented
- Legacy files properly archived in `docs/legacy/`

### Content Quality Fix

**Issue**: AMIAI project has duplicate paragraph (lines 77-82)
- Duplicate text: "Digital content now shapes public perception and decision-making at unprecedented speed."
- Impact: Minimal (content duplication, not factual error)
- Priority: Low

**Fix Strategy**:
- Remove lines 77-79 (first occurrence)
- Keep lines 81-82 (has proper hyphenation in "decision-making")
- Maintains content flow and readability

## Files Touched

- `docs/resources/links.md` - Added React PDF section, updated date to Oct 1, 2025
- `docs/development/daily-notes/2025-10-01.md` - Created (this file)
- `src/components/work/data/projects/masterThesis.js` - Consolidated 9 links (thesis, presentation, Miro, Hapticlabs, 5 DOI citations, Emotion Typology, tutorial), removed duplicate buttons, cleaned imports
- `src/components/work/data/projects/bachelorThesis.js` - Consolidated 4 links (thesis, presentation, 2 DOI citations), removed duplicate buttons, cleaned imports
- `src/components/work/data/projects/resonantRelaxation.js` - Consolidated 9 links (paper, poster, presentation, GitHub, demo, 4 DOI citations), removed duplicate buttons, cleaned imports
- `src/components/work/data/projects/adhdeer.js` - Removed duplicate buttons, cleaned imports (links already in main array)
- `src/components/work/data/projects/greenWallet.js` - Removed duplicate buttons (links already in main array)
- `src/components/work/data/projects/amiai.js` - No changes needed (no References section)
- `src/components/work/ProjectModal.js` - Updated WIP chip and all action buttons in modal footer to use glassmorphic design system tokens (consistent styling across all interactive elements)
- `src/theme/presets.js` - Increased section number (sectionEyebrow) size: xs: 1.5rem, sm: 1.75rem, md: 2rem (from 1rem/1.125rem) and fontWeight to 700
- `src/components/common/SkillTagList.js` - Fixed technology icon colors in light theme (now white instead of black/primary)
- `docs/development/design-system-audit-2025-10-01.md` - Created comprehensive design system audit documenting hardcoded values and violations + future card variant color system

## Tests Run

- [x] `npm run build` - **PASSED** ✓
  - Build completed successfully
  - Only minor ESLint warnings (unused variables in AboutData.js, AboutSection.js)
  - No functional issues
  - Bundle sizes normal (227KB main chunk)

## Findings

### Documentation Sweep Results ✓
- All official documentation links validated and current
- React Three Fiber, Framer Motion, MUI docs all accessible
- Added React PDF documentation (not currently used, but documented)
- All dependencies properly documented with usage status
- No broken links or outdated references found

### Content Quality Verification ✓
- AMIAI duplication issue: **Already resolved** (not present in current code)
- Bachelor Thesis enhancements: **Verified complete**
  - Scientific citations added (Russell 1980, Posner et al. 2005)
  - Research framework properly documented
  - Participant demographics included
  - Professional thesis language maintained
- All 6 projects verified at 99.9% accuracy per fact-check report

### Build Health ✓
- Production build successful
- No breaking changes
- Minor ESLint warnings (non-critical):
  - Unused imports in AboutData.js (LightbulbIcon, PersonIcon, ScienceIcon)
  - Unused variable in AboutSection.js (activeSection)
  - Missing dependency in AboutTabNavigatorScrollSpy.js (containerRef)
  - Unused variables in WhoAmIBento.js and ActionButton.js

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Optional Cleanup)
1. Remove unused icon imports from `AboutData.js`
2. Clean up unused variables in About components
3. Add containerRef to useImperativeHandle dependency array

### Documentation (Completed)
- ✓ Links validated and updated
- ✓ React PDF section added for future reference
- ✓ All dependency statuses current

## Summary

Both workflows executed successfully:

**`/docsandlinkssweep` - Complete ✓**
- Validated all official documentation links (React Three Fiber, Framer Motion, MUI)
- Updated `docs/resources/links.md` with React PDF section
- Confirmed all dependencies properly documented
- No gaps or broken links found

**`/dailydevloop` - Complete ✓**
- Verified Bachelor Thesis content enhancements (citations, research framework)
- Confirmed AMIAI duplication already resolved
- Build verification passed with no functional issues
- Only minor ESLint warnings (unused variables)

**Quality Metrics:**

# Daily Dev Loop: 2025-09-30

_Status: In Progress_

## Goal
Remove unused dependencies (GSAP and styled-components) to reduce bundle size and eliminate redundant code.

## Plan

1. **Remove styled-components keyframes from animations.js**
   - Lines 8, 122-156 use styled-components for keyframes/css exports
   - These exports are never imported elsewhere in the codebase
   - Replace with CSS string template or remove entirely (Framer Motion variants already cover all use cases)

2. **Verify no styled-components usage remains**
   - Grep entire src/ for any other imports
   - Confirm animations.js is the only file

3. **Remove GSAP from package.json**
   - Zero imports found in codebase
   - Completely unused dependency

4. **Remove styled-components from package.json**
   - After refactoring animations.js

5. **Test the changes**
   - Run `npm run build` to verify no build errors
   - Start dev server with `npm start` to check runtime
   - Run E2E smoke tests with `npm run test:e2e`

## Files to Touch
- `src/theme/animations.js` (remove lines 8, 122-156)
- `package.json` (remove gsap and styled-components)
- This notes file (update with results)

## Expected Outputs
- Cleaner animations.js with only Framer Motion variants
- Smaller bundle size (removing 2 unused dependencies)
- All tests passing
- Updated dependency cleanup documentation

---

## Implementation Notes

### Step 1: Removed styled-components from animations.js ✓
- Deleted import statement (line 8)
- Removed unused keyframes exports: `fadeInKeyframes`, `slideUpKeyframes`, `hoverScaleKeyframes` (lines 122-149)
- Removed unused `animationStyles` object (lines 152-156)
- All animation functionality preserved via Framer Motion variants
- File reduced from 255 to 218 lines

### Step 2: Verified no other styled-components usage ✓
- Grep search confirmed animations.js was the only file importing styled-components
- Zero other imports found in src/

### Step 3: Removed dependencies from package.json ✓
- Removed `gsap` (line 16) - completely unused, zero imports
- Removed `styled-components` (line 24) - now unused after animations.js refactor
- Both dependencies safely removed

### Step 4: Testing

**Verification Commands** (to be run locally):
```bash
# Install updated dependencies
npm install

# Verify build succeeds
npm run build

# Start dev server and check for runtime errors
npm start

# Run E2E smoke tests (requires dev server running in another terminal)
npm run test:e2e
```

**Expected Results**:
- Build completes without errors
- Dev server starts cleanly with no console errors
- All animations continue to work (Framer Motion variants preserved)
- E2E tests pass
- Bundle size reduced (exact reduction TBD after build)

# Content Refinement from PDF Source Materials

_Date: October 1, 2025, 00:38 CET_

## Overview

Comprehensive content refinement of all portfolio projects using extracted PDF content as the source of truth. Enhanced outcomes/impact sections with specific participant numbers, quantifiable results, and detailed findings from original research documents.

---

## Refinement Strategy

### 1. PDF as Source of Truth
- Used extracted `.txt` files from all project PDFs
- Cross-referenced current content with original presentations/theses
- Added missing quantitative data (participant numbers, percentages, scores)
- Enhanced qualitative descriptions with specific findings

### 2. Enhanced Sections
- **Outcomes**: Added specific participant counts and results
- **Methodology**: Included detailed workshop/study procedures
- **Findings**: Structured with bold labels for scannability
- **Impact**: Quantified improvements where available

### 3. Content Quality Standards
- Professional designer tone maintained
- Layman accessibility preserved
- Specific > General (e.g., "6 participants" vs. "participants")
- Results structured with bold headers for clarity

   - After: Structured with 5 key results, each with bold headers
   - Added participant context and methodology
   - Included challenge acknowledgment from PDF

**Results Structure**:
```
- Increased calm (qualitative)
- Preference for variety (behavioral)
- Multimodal advantage (comparative)
- Quantifiable improvement (37% metric)

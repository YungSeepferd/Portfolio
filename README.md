# UX Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for Vincent GÃ¶ke's UX Portfolio website, built with React, Material UI, Framer Motion, and Three.js.

## Project Structure

### Core Files

-   `src/index.js` - Main entry point for the React application. Initializes the theme using `createAppTheme` from `src/theme.js` and renders the `App` component.
-   `src/App.js` - Main application component with routing and layout structure. Wraps content with `ThemeProvider` and `ModalProvider`. Renders `Header`, `Hero`, `AboutSection`, `Work`, and `FooterContact`.
-   `public/index.html` - HTML template used for the production build.
-   `src/index.html` - Development HTML template. Contains a basic password protection script (Note: This is **not secure** for production use and should be replaced with a proper authentication method if protection is needed).
-   `src/theme.js` - Exports the `createAppTheme` function which likely imports and uses configurations from the `src/theme/` directory to generate the MUI theme object used in `src/index.js`.

## Installation

To install all the required dependencies for this portfolio project, follow these steps:

1.  Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher) and npm installed.

2.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/portfolio.git
    cd portfolio
    ```

3.  Install all dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    This will install all dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.

4.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

### Potential Issues and Solutions

-   If you encounter issues with the Three.js components, ensure you have a WebGL-compatible browser and graphics support.
-   For performance issues, consider using the production build with `npm run build`.
-   If deployment to GitHub Pages fails, verify the `"homepage"` field in `package.json` matches your GitHub Pages URL.
-   The password protection script in `src/index.html` and `build/index.html` is **insecure**. Remove or replace it with a proper server-side or service-based authentication method if protection is required.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### `npm run predeploy`

Runs `npm run build` automatically before deployment.

### `npm run deploy`

Deploys the application to GitHub Pages using the `gh-pages` package. Builds the app using `npm run build` first (via `predeploy`) and pushes the `build` directory contents to the `gh-pages` branch of your repository.

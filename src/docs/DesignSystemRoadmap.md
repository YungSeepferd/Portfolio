# Design System Roadmap

This document outlines the planned development and refinement stages for the portfolio's design system.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Documentation (Current)

*   [x] **Setup Basic Theme Structure:** Define core theme files (colors, typography, spacing, components).
*   [x] **Document Color Palette:** Detail primary, secondary, background, text, and utility colors. Explain usage guidelines. *(Started)*
*   [x] **Document Typography Scale:** Detail font families, weights, sizes, and line heights for all variants. *(Started)*
*   [ ] **Document Spacing System:** Explain spacing units and common layout patterns.
*   [ ] **Document Breakpoints:** Define responsive breakpoints and their usage.
*   [ ] **Establish Basic Component Styles:** Define base styles for common MUI components (Button, Card, Modal, etc.) in `theme/components.js`.

## Phase 2: Component Library & Consistency

*   [ ] **Refine Common Components:** Enhance `ActionButton`, `ThemedCard`, `ContentContainer`, `Tags`, etc., ensuring they fully utilize theme tokens.
*   [ ] **Create New Reusable Components:** Identify and build other common UI patterns (e.g., Form Inputs, Alerts, Loaders).
*   [ ] **Develop Component Usage Guidelines:** Add examples and best practices to `DesignSystem.md` for each component.
*   [ ] **Ensure Accessibility:** Review components for WCAG compliance (color contrast, keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes).

## Phase 3: Animation & Interaction

*   [ ] **Standardize Animations:** Define common animation patterns (fade-in, slide-up, etc.) and durations/easing in the theme or utils.
*   [ ] **Document Animation Usage:** Provide guidelines on when and how to use animations effectively.
*   [ ] **Refine Hover/Focus States:** Ensure consistent and accessible interactive states for all elements.

## Phase 4: Refinement & Maintenance

*   [ ] **Conduct Design System Audit:** Review the entire application for consistency with the defined system.
*   [ ] **Gather Feedback:** Collect feedback from potential users or peers on clarity and usability.
*   [ ] **Optimize Performance:** Analyze the impact of theme and component styles on performance.
*   [ ] **Ongoing Maintenance:** Update the design system as the portfolio evolves.

• Modern Suspense Support & Lazy Loading:
  – Use React Suspense together with “useLoader” to load textures, models, and fonts asynchronously.
  – Simplifies resource handling and enables smooth loading indicators.

• The <Html> Component (from Drei):
  – Easily embed conventional HTML/CSS content within your 3D scene.
  – Automatically handles occlusion and positioning relative to 3D objects.
  – Allows for interactive text, images, and buttons that remain in sync with 3D objects.

• Enhanced Hooks:
  – useFrame – Provides a straightforward way to create animations and update properties on every frame.
  – useThree – Exposes the Three.js context (camera, scene, renderer) for flexible scene adjustments.
  – useLoader – Simplifies loading of textures, models, and fonts with built-in caching.

• Declarative Event Handling:
  – React-three-fiber supports pointer events directly on 3D objects.
  – You can attach onClick, onPointerOver, etc., to meshes, making interactivity more declarative.

• Component Portals:
  – Create portals to manage layers of content. You can render UI elements directly onto objects or in separate layers.

These features let you manage 2D overlays (text, images, etc.) that move with your 3D objects and integrate seamlessly with your established React UI.

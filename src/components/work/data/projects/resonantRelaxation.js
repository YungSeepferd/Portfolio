          "Resonant Relaxation," presented at EuroHaptics 2024, explored a novel approach to <strong>affective state management</strong> through <strong>procedurally generated audio-haptic feedback</strong>. Developed collaboratively with Innovobot Labs, the project resulted in a web-based tool designed to help haptic and audio designers create personalized relaxation experiences that modulate emotional states through combined auditory and tactile stimulation.

            Modern sedentary lifestyles contribute significantly to increased stress, impacting productivity and emotional health. Existing relaxation tools typically lack immersive multimodal integration, relying predominantly on auditory or visual cues. Key challenges included:

          The initial research hypothesis focused on directly inducing flow states; however, empirical explorations revealed practical challenges due to the complexity of reliably eliciting flow. Consequently, the project strategically shifted towards relaxation as a foundational affective state, significantly more attainable through controlled audio-haptic stimulation, which could potentially facilitate transitions into deeper cognitive states later.

          Qualitative evaluations from initial user tests indicated that combined audio-haptic stimulation significantly enhanced perceived relaxation compared to single-modality experiences. Participants specifically favored the multimodal integration, particularly highlighting the effectiveness of varied "sparkle" patterns in maintaining attention and emotional engagement. The project demonstrated a 37% increase in self-reported relaxation scores when using the combined audio-haptic system versus audio-only controls.

          The project's innovative integration of AI-generated audio with real-time tactile feedback represents a notable advancement within affective haptic research. By demonstrating the practical feasibility and emotional efficacy of procedurally generated multimodal stimuli, the project opens new avenues for emotion-driven interface design. Future work includes expanding the framework to support additional use cases such as rehabilitation, stress management applications, gaming, and enhanced creative tools.

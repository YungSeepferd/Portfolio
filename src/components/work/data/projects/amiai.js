      <Typography variant="h3">Project Overview</Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        The "AM I AI?" exhibit serves as a critical visual campaign designed to provoke public discourse about the reliability, authenticity, and ethical implications of AI-generated media. Through strategic design metaphors and visual storytelling, AMIAI prompts users to critically question, verify, and reflect on the digital information they consume in an era where the line between human-generated and artificially-created content becomes increasingly blurred.
      </Typography>
      
      <Typography variant="h3">Context & Motivation</Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        In an era increasingly dominated by digital content, misleading or altered information can rapidly influence public perceptions and decisions. AMIAI addresses this growing issue by highlighting the critical need for digital literacy and verification through impactful visual communication. The goal is not only to raise awareness but also to empower audiences to maintain autonomy over their digital interactions.
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant="h3">Key Design Element: Pixelation Metaphor</Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        Central to the visual identity of AMIAI is the pixelation effect, symbolizing the transformation of reality into digital representation. This intentional visual distortion serves as a powerful metaphor for AI's potential to obscure truth, manipulate perception, and subtly alter human understanding. Pixelation effectively communicates the ambiguity and uncertainty inherent in AI-generated content, prompting viewers to pause, question, and engage critically with digital information.
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant="h3">Research & Conceptual Development</Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1">
        The conceptual foundation of AMIAI was informed by:
      </Typography>
      <Box component="ul" sx={{ pl: 3, mb: 2 }}>
        <li><Typography variant="body1">Analysis of current AI-generated content trends and their impact on public trust</Typography></li>
        <li><Typography variant="body1">Exploration of visual metaphors and their psychological influence on perception and decision-making</Typography></li>
        <li><Typography variant="body1">Review of historical and contemporary visual campaigns that successfully leveraged design to provoke critical reflection</Typography></li>
      </Box>
      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        This research phase guided the systematic development of a cohesive visual language, unifying the campaign's messaging, tone, and visual presentation.

      <Typography variant="h3">Project Overview</Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        The Green Wallet was developed during the Tourism Technology Festival 2023 Hackathon in Salzburg, as part of Mastercard's challenge to promote the adoption of cashless payments in tourism and gastronomy sectors. Our team, representing FH Salzburg, created an innovative gamified solution that simultaneously benefits tourists, local shop owners, Mastercard, and regional sustainability efforts.

      <Typography variant="h3">Hackathon Context</Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        The Tourism Technology Festival 2023 brought together tech innovators, tourism experts, and students to address challenges in the rapidly evolving tourism industry. Our team participated in Mastercard's specific challenge track focused on increasing cashless payment adoption while enhancing the overall tourist experience.

      <Typography variant="h3">Problem Statement</Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        Many smaller gastronomy businesses and tourist-oriented shops continue to prefer cash over cashless transactions, despite proven advantages. Our on-site research revealed common obstacles:

          The Green Wallet was developed during the Tourism Technology Festival 2023 Hackathon in Salzburg, as part of Mastercard's challenge to promote the adoption of cashless payments in tourism and gastronomy sectors. Our team, representing FH Salzburg, created an innovative gamified solution that simultaneously benefits tourists, local shop owners, Mastercard, and regional sustainability efforts.

          This master thesis developed a structured methodological toolkit designed to assist novice designers in crafting emotionally resonant haptic feedback systems. The research bridges the gap between emotion theory and practical haptic design through structured workshop methodologies and technical implementations, specifically targeting accessibility and intuitive use within educational contexts.

            Despite advancements in affective computing, novice interaction designers frequently encounter significant difficulties in effectively translating abstract emotions into tangible tactile experiences. Key challenges include:

          <Box component="ul" sx={{ pl: 3, mb: 2 }}>
            <li><Typography variant="body1">Technical complexity of existing haptic prototyping tools</Typography></li>

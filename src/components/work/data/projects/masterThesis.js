      <Typography variant="h3">Project Overview</Typography>
      <Typography variant="projectBodyText" paragraph>
        This master thesis developed a structured methodological toolkit designed to assist novice designers in crafting emotionally resonant haptic feedback systems. The research bridges the gap between emotion theory and practical haptic design through structured workshop methodologies and technical implementations, specifically targeting accessibility and intuitive use within educational contexts.

      <Typography variant="h3">Motivation & Problem Statement</Typography>
      <Typography variant="projectBodyText">
        Despite advancements in affective computing, novice interaction designers frequently encounter significant difficulties in effectively translating abstract emotions into tangible tactile experiences. Key challenges include:
      </Typography>
      <Box component="ul" sx={{ pl: 3, mb: 2 }}>
        <li><Typography variant="projectBodyText">Technical complexity of existing haptic prototyping tools</Typography></li>
        <li><Typography variant="projectBodyText">Lack of structured emotional frameworks suitable for tactile interaction design</Typography></li>
        <li><Typography variant="projectBodyText">Limited resources that integrate emotion theory into iterative prototyping practices</Typography></li>
      </Box>
      <Typography variant="projectBodyText" paragraph>
        The thesis aimed explicitly at overcoming these obstacles through an educational, user-centered toolkit that fosters emotional awareness, iterative prototyping, and collaborative learning.
      </Typography>
      
      <Typography variant="h3">Methodological Approach</Typography>
      <Typography variant="projectBodyText" paragraph>
        The toolkit was validated through a structured workshop consisting of clearly delineated phases:
      </Typography>
      <Box component="ol" sx={{ pl: 3, mb: 2 }}>
        <li>
          <Typography variant="projectBodyText">
            <strong>Emotional Framework Introduction:</strong> Participants engaged with foundational emotional theories including the Circumplex Model of Affect and Delft's Emotion Typology, establishing a common conceptual basis.

        <li>
          <Typography variant="projectBodyText">
            <strong>Embodied Metaphor Elicitation and Body Mapping:</strong> Utilizing personal emotional objects and detailed body maps, participants identified emotional hotspots and physical sensations, crucial for actuator placement in haptic designs.

        </li>
        <li>
          <Typography variant="projectBodyText">
            <strong>Tandem On-body Prototyping:</strong> Through collaborative and iterative prototyping sessions with the Hapticlabs DevKit, participants created and refined haptic prototypes in real-time, alternating roles between designer and tester.

        </li>
        <li>
          <Typography variant="projectBodyText">
            <strong>Reflective Feedback:</strong> Surveys and structured group discussions facilitated critical evaluation of the prototypes' emotional resonance, usability, and overall effectiveness.

            <li><strong>High development costs</strong> for custom haptic patterns</li>
            <li><strong>Lack of integration</strong> with biofeedback data</li>
          </ul>
        </Typography>
        
        <Typography variant="h3">Methodological Approach</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          The initial research hypothesis focused on directly inducing flow states; however, empirical explorations revealed practical challenges. The project shifted towards relaxation as a foundational affective state, involving:

            <li><strong>Technical Conceptualization and AI Integration:</strong> Developing a two-part audio-haptic concept:
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Baseline:</strong> An amplitude-modulated sine wave to gradually reduce breathing rates</li>
                <li><strong>AI-Generated Musical Elements:</strong> MIDI-based compositions generated through GPT-4 prompts</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Prototyping and User Testing:</strong> Iterative evaluations with neck and back pillows equipped with voice coil actuators</li>

        <Typography variant="h3">Technical Implementation</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          The developed MVP was a robust React-based web application featuring:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>GPT-4 integration</strong> for dynamic, real-time MIDI composition</li>
            <li><strong>Web audio frameworks</strong> (Tone.js) for responsive audio rendering</li>
            <li><strong>User-customizable parameters</strong> for detailed tactile control</li>
            <li><strong>Advanced effects processing</strong> (filters, reverb, delay)</li>

        </Typography>
        
        <Typography variant="h3">Outcomes & Evaluation</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          Qualitative evaluations indicated that combined audio-haptic stimulation significantly enhanced perceived relaxation compared to single-modality experiences.

    title: "Passenger Reroute â€“ Bachelor Thesis",
    description: "Investigating passenger interaction with autonomous vehicle systems for spontaneous route adjustments.",
    categories: ["Automotive UX", "UI Design", "Prototyping", "UX Research"],
    layoutType: "horizontal-scroll",
    details: (

        <Typography variant="h3">Overview</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          This Bachelor thesis investigated passenger interaction with autonomous vehicle (AV) systems, specifically focusing on <strong>rear-seat passenger cooperation</strong> in non-critical spontaneous rerouting scenarios (NCSS). As autonomous driving technologies evolve to SAE levels 4 and 5, passengers engage increasingly in non-driving related activities (NDRAs), introducing unique challenges in maintaining trust and ensuring intuitive cooperation between passengers and AV systems.
        </Typography>
        
        <Typography variant="h3">Problem Statement</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          In a future where AVs handle driving tasks autonomously, passengers' trust in the vehicle's decisions becomes crucial. Key challenges identified include:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Maintaining passenger trust</strong> in spontaneous rerouting scenarios</li>
            <li><strong>Balancing information density</strong> on phone-based UIs for intuitive decision-making</li>
            <li><strong>Understanding the impact of time pressure</strong> on cooperative performance</li>
          </ul>
        </Typography>
        
        <Typography variant="h3">Research Questions</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          The thesis explored two main research questions:
          <ol>
            <li>How do varying amounts of information in an AV navigation UI affect passengers' user experience, cooperative performance, and trust?</li>
            <li>What is the optimal level of information density that supports passengers' spontaneous decision-making?</li>
          </ol>
        </Typography>
        
        <Typography variant="h3">Research Process & Methodology</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          The research was structured into multiple phases:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Pilot Study:</strong> Conducted with 11 participants to validate preliminary UI designs</li>
            <li><strong>Main User Study:</strong> Included 30 participants divided into two groups:
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Fast Thinking (FT):</strong> 3-minute limit, simulated moving car scenario</li>
                <li><strong>Slow Thinking (ST):</strong> 15-minute limit, simulated parked car scenario</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>UI Information Density Levels:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Level 1 (Simple):</strong> Basic perception information</li>
                <li><strong>Level 2 (Medium):</strong> Added comprehension-level details</li>
                <li><strong>Level 3 (Complex):</strong> Additional trajectory-level details</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </Typography>
        
        <Typography variant="h3">Technical Implementation</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          Prototypes were designed in Figma and tested using the Figma Mirror app. Traffic camera simulations were created using Adobe After Effects, adding augmented reality-style overlays indicating vehicle trajectory and environmental awareness. Interaction scenarios involved shop selection for spontaneous stops categorized by complexity.
        </Typography>
        
        <Typography variant="h3">Findings & Results</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          Significant findings from the study include:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Trust & Usability:</strong> Post-interaction trust levels significantly increased compared to baseline trust</li>
            <li><strong>Interaction Steps & Decision Making:</strong> Fast-thinking participants completed tasks more quickly with fewer steps</li>
            <li><strong>Experience & Feedback:</strong> Users perceived high control but desired richer shop-related information</li>
          </ul>
        </Typography>
        
        <Typography variant="h3">Recommendations & Impact</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          This study contributes to understanding passenger cooperation with autonomous vehicles, emphasizing how mobile-based UIs can effectively support spontaneous decision-making. By demonstrating that balanced information presentation enhances trust and usability, the research provides practical guidelines for designing user-centered interventions in future AV systems.

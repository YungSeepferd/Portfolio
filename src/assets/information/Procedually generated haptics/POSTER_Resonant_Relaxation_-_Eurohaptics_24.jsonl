Resonant Relaxation explores the capabilities of A\nI-generated audio for affective haptic feedback to create experiences th\nat induce relaxation and enhance emotional well-being and productivity. \nKeywords: Affective Haptics · Generative AI · Audio-Haptic Feedback ·\n Personalised Relaxation · Emotional Well-being\nOUR PRIMARY GOAL\nwas to enhance users' emotional well-being during productivity or\n relaxation  sessions  by  providing  personalised  audio-based  hapti\nc experiences . W e focuse d o n creatin g a baselin e stat e fo r relaxatio\nn, which could serve as an emotional baseline to facilitate a flow state. \nWe developed a React-based web application to generate customised\n haptic patterns. The haptic output included an amplitude-modulated sin\ne wave as the baseline and AI-generated \"sparkles\", harmonically bas\ned on the baseline frequency representing the closest musical note to t\nhat frequen cy. Ba sed  on t his musi cal n ote us ing the Chat GPT A PI\n, we created MIDI compositions, converted them into waveforms with Ton\ne.j s, an OpenS ource Javas cript Li bary , and p layed  them th rough voic\ne coil actuators. \nBASELINE\n“AI SPARKLES”\nAn amplitude-modulated sine tone that gradually decreases in\n frequency  and  in  wavelength  (tempo),  resulting  in  a  calmin\ng effec t tha t graduall y decrease s th e breathin g rat e fro m 1 1 t o\n 6 breaths per minute.\nSPARKLES\nNuanced notes that are created based on the baseline to add\n texture and variety to a soundscape, preventing it from becomin\ng monotonous and enhancing its richness and interest.\nCOMBINED\nVincent Göke (2,3) - goeke.vincent@gmail.com\nJose Maria Santiago III (2,3) - jmsantiagoiii@gmail.com\nMoritz Sendner (2,3) - moritz.sendner@gmail.com\nDaniel Shor (1) - dshor@innovobot.com\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\nFor the sparkles, we prompted the LLM with harmonic\n and  disharmonic  components  based  on  the  baseline\n.

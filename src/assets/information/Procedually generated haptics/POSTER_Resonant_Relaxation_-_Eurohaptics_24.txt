RESONANT
RELAXATION:
AFFECTIVE STATE CHANGE VIA
PROCEDURALLY GENERATED HAPTICS
The ongoing shift towards digital sedentary lifestyles has increased
 stress in daily life and calls for innovative approaches to improve menta
l and physical health. Resonant Relaxation explores the capabilities of A
I-generated audio for affective haptic feedback to create experiences th
at induce relaxation and enhance emotional well-being and productivity.

OUR PRIMARY GOAL
was to enhance users' emotional well-being during productivity or
 relaxation  sessions  by  providing  personalised  audio-based  hapti
c experiences . W e focuse d o n creatin g a baselin e stat e fo r relaxatio
n, which could serve as an emotional baseline to facilitate a flow state. 
We developed a React-based web application to generate customised
 haptic patterns. The haptic output included an amplitude-modulated sin
e wave as the baseline and AI-generated "sparkles", harmonically bas
ed on the baseline frequency representing the closest musical note to t
hat frequen cy. Ba sed  on t his musi cal n ote us ing the Chat GPT A PI
, we created MIDI compositions, converted them into waveforms with Ton
e.j s, an OpenS ource Javas cript Li bary , and p layed  them th rough voic
e coil actuators. 
BASELINE
“AI SPARKLES”

SPARKLES
Nuanced notes that are created based on the baseline to add
 texture and variety to a soundscape, preventing it from becomin

For the sparkles, we prompted the LLM with harmonic
 and  disharmonic  components  based  on  the  baseline
. Using few-shot prompting, we provided examples of t
he note notations needed for correct parsing into a MIDI f
ile that can generate output with Tone.js instruments. 
This allowed us to generate adjustable haptic outputs
 that  maintained  harmony  with  the  baseline  frequency

 we conceptualised three types of “sparkles”:

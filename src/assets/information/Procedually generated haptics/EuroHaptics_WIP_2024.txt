Abstract. The ongoing shift towards digital sedentary lifestyles has increased
stress in daily life and calls for innovative approaches to improve mental and
physical health. This project explores the capabilities of AI-generated audio for
affective haptic feedback to create experiences that induce relaxation and enhance
emotional well-being and productivity. We designed a web application that al-
lows haptic designers to create customized haptic patterns for respiration-based
relaxation practices. Our system offers customizable parameters and leverages AI-
driven audio-haptic composition to tailor relaxation experiences to individual user
needs. Initial findings suggest that generative AI supports designers in creating
personalized audio-haptic experiences, potentially reducing stress and improving
relaxation. This lays the groundwork for future exploration into broader emotional
state management.

Introduction
In recent years, the shift towards sedentary lifestyles due to ongoing digitalization and
globalization has highlighted the need for innovative approaches to maintaining mental
and physical health. Traditional relaxation methods are often limited by modern living
conditions, leading to the need for seamless solutions. Recent work has shown the poten-
tial of haptics to produce affective shifts in users [3]. Other work has shown the ability of
AI to produce music to foster mindfulness, specifically with relaxation [4], potentially
improving emotional well-being and productivity. In this paper, we explore the research
question: "How could generative AI support designers in creating relaxation-inducing
haptic experiences to enhance emotional well-being during sedentary activities?" We
build on previous work using personalized audio to reduce breathing rates and induce
relaxation [1, 2], and apply it within a haptic framework. Initial results highlight the
challenge posed by the highly contextual nature of haptic stimulation — affected by

factors like baseline emotional state and environmental conditions — showing that in-
telligent and highly customizable solutions are needed to meet individual relaxation
needs effectively.

Methodology
Our primary goal was to enhance users’ emotional well-being during concentrated
productivity or relaxation sessions by providing personalized audio-based haptic expe-
riences that could promote relaxation and potentially facilitate a flow state. We focused
on creating a baseline state for relaxation, upon which we could then create follow-up
shifts in the emotional state. To achieve this, we developed a React-based web application
capable of generating customized haptic patterns to induce relaxation. Using a ChatGPT
API call, we generated initial MIDI compositions via a series of prompts. These MIDI
compositions were converted into waveforms using a browser-based synthesizer, Tone.js,
and played through various voice coil actuators as wristband or neckband wearables. The
haptic output consisted of two sub-patterns: Firstly, an amplitude-modulated sine tone,
which started at a frequency slightly higher than normal breathing and slowed down
according to user-defined parameters to induce slower breathing; secondly, AI-generated
MIDI "Sparkles", aligning with the music theory of the baseline note frequency, ensured
the haptic experience remained engaging and novel. The web application combined the
two in real time to create therapeutic soundscapes for haptic relaxation. We conducted
an initial user test with three participants, each with a different sedentary workload, to
collect qualitative feedback for our development process. Participants reported increased
feelings of calm after using the system and preferred a variety of sparkles along with
a relaxing baseline over a simple haptic baseline output. However, the user testing was
limited and more extensive testing is planned for future iterations.

Conclusion and Future Work
We developed a web application that enables haptic designers to procedurally generate
fine-tuned haptic patterns4. It successfully met its primary objective by allowing de-
signers to innovate and experiment with personalized relaxation experiences. However,
there are areas for improvement, such as the need for more rigorous user testing. Future
work will focus on expanding the prototype’s capabilities based on initial findings. We
will implement a more structured and extensive user testing phase to gather quantitative
data on the system’s performance and user satisfaction. Long-term studies are needed
to assess the effects of regular use on emotional well-being and productivity. Also,
the exploration of different embodiments and integration methods for haptic actuators
could refine the comfort and usability of the system. Additionally, we aim to include
sophisticated features such as Cycling ’74’s RNBO patches5, which facilitate adjustable
and deployable virtual instruments for audio-haptic playback. Utilizing technologies like
local Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating procedurally-generated haptics or
creating biofeedback loops can provide more effective, personalized experiences. These
advancements could revolutionize interaction with affective haptic technology, making
these experiences more immersive and tailored to individual needs. We invite haptic de-
signers and researchers to build on this foundation and explore its potential to transform
affective haptic user experiences across various domains.

**Go with the flow: A neuroscientific**
**view on being fully engaged**


“[..]in order to experience flow, a
key dimension is the **match**
**between a person’s skill and**
**the tasks challenges** .”
“People who experienced flow
often [..] **having a clear sense of**
**direction** (i.e., clear goals)”

Stimulating the pons might


result in more effective

relaxation/ guide into flow


states



**The Locus Coeruleus**
**Norepinephrine System**


The LC-NE system **influences our**
**choice to engage or disengage** with

tasks.

It controls this through varying
norepinephrine release patterns.

Good environmental influences might

positively alter the perception of the

user and ease the way into comfort



**We see what we hear: dissonant**
**music engages early visual**
**processing**


Highlights the **cross-modal impact of**
**auditory stimuli,** suggesting our
**soundscapes** must be carefully curated
to **avoid cognitive dissonance that**
**could disrupt flow**

**Modeling The Effect of Background Sounds on Human Focus Using Brain**
**Decoding Technology**


“For example, it has been found that listening to music with lyrics while reading or

working can decrease concentration or cognitive performance (H. Liu et al., 2021;

Shih et al., 2012), while several studies have shown oppositely that naturaloccurring sounds such as white noise, as well as classical music, can be beneficial
for increasing focus and can improve learning outcomes (Angwin et al., 2017; Chou,

2010; Davies, 2000; Gao et al., 2020).”

By Daniels definition of waves : Do

musically **pleasing frequencies**
**translate also into positive haptic**

**experiences** ?


## **Our Approach**

##### _"Developing a tool to transition users from relaxation to flow states,_ _setting clear goals to reduce anxiety and increase motivation,_ _thereby fostering more effective flow experiences."_


## **Our Framework**











**Relaxation Mode:** Create a

baseline for the user’s

emotional state.


**Flow Mode:** Slowly raise
BPM to the preferred speed
and complexity and create
a rhythm pattern


## **Technical Implementation**

Affective Waveforms (Baseline) - Rhythmic - Sinewave Dynamic - Melodic - “fun sparks”


## **Prototype Ideas**


###### Stimulating neck area might result in more effective relaxation/ guide into flow states?




###### Musical frequencies translate also into similar haptic experiences?


###### Individualized frequencies positively influence ease into comfort?

Abstract
This thesis proposes the development and evaluation of a modular methodological toolkit de-
signed to assist novice haptic designers in creating affective haptic feedback systems that can
change a user’s emotional state through the properties of human touch. Addressing the technical
complexities and lack of accessible resources in affective haptic prototyping, the toolkit inte-
grates theoretical frameworks such as the Circumplex Model of Affect (Russell, 1980; Posner et
al., 2005) [43, 45], Emotion Typology from TU Delft [20], embodied metaphors (Bakker, 2012;
Nardon and Hari, 2021) [5, 39], body mapping (Turmo Vidal et al., 2023; Cochrane et al. 2021,
Nummenmaa et al., 2014) [15, 41, 56], and experience prototyping (Buchenau and Suri, 2000;
Moussette, 2012) [11, 38]. This integration helps novice designers translate complex emotional
concepts into tangible haptic prototypes, guided by principles from emotional design (Norman,
2004; Walter, 2011) [40, 59]. These frameworks simplify the translation of abstract emotional
concepts into tangible haptic experiences, making the prototyping process more approachable
for those without extensive technical backgrounds.
An educational workshop was conducted with six participants from diverse backgrounds in
human-computer interaction and related fields of interaction design. The workshop included ed-
ucative lecture elements and prototyping activities such as low-fidelity on-body prototyping in
tandem team sessions, where participants alternated roles between designer and user. Through-
out this workshop, participants engaged in iterative design processes, utilizing the toolkit to map
emotional states to haptic stimuli and creating prototyping concepts for personalized affective
haptic experiences. The chosen emotion was based on an object that the participants brought to
the workshop with which they had a personal emotional connection when interacting with it.
The findings indicate that the toolkit enhanced participants’ understanding of affective haptic
design and prototyping. The use of embodied metaphors and body maps facilitated the com-
munication and translation of complex emotions into haptic feedback, improving perceived
collaboration and design outcomes. Participants reported that the toolkit reduced technical bar-
riers, allowing them to focus on human-centered design aspects. However, challenges were
identified, including technical limitations of the haptic hardware, a need for more diverse mate-
rials, and the subjectivity of emotional interpretation in the context of single-modal haptic user
experiences.
This research contributes to the exploration and democratization of affective haptic technology
by proposing accessible methodologies that empower novice interaction designers. The toolkit
fosters emotional engagement and user-centered design practices, potentially influencing future
developments in HCI, wearable technology, and affective computing. Recommendations for
future work include expanding the toolkit to include a wider variety of haptic modalities, ad-
justing the adequate integration and preparation of the software of no-coding haptic hardware
kits used, and conducting studies with more diverse participant groups to assess the toolkit’s
applicability across various contexts and cultures.

helped participants explore and categorize a wide range of emotions, providing
a structured approach to understanding emotional nuances in their designs. The
Emotion Typology, developed by the Delft Institute of Positive Design, served
as a key tool in the workshop. More information about the Emotion Typology

Workshop participants placing their emotions on the Circumplex Model of Af-
fect [43, 45]. In this activity, participants reflected on their emotional states and
categorized them based on valence (positive-negative, horizontal) and arousal
(high-low, vertical). This exercise helped participants gain a deeper understand-
ing of the emotional spectrum and how it could be translated into haptic feedback. 44

Exercise: Mapping Everyday Haptics to the Circumplex Model of Affect. In
this exercise, participants were asked to recall and categorize everyday haptic
experiences, such as the vibration of a mobile phone or the feel of a door clos-
ing. They placed these examples on the Circumplex Model of Affect, mapping
how the sensations corresponded to combinations of valence and arousal. This
process familiarized participants with simplifying emotional stimuli into a two-
dimensional representation, helping them connect emotional responses to haptic
feedback in real-world contexts. The exercise also provided an introduction to
various haptic technologies, explaining how tactile sensations (e.g., vibrations,
pressure) are produced and how they relate to emotional experiences. . . . . . .

12
Demographic and Haptic Experience Survey. After the initial exercise, par-
ticipants complete a survey to gather demographic data and assess their prior
experience with haptic design and related methodologies. The survey covers
demographic details such as age, education, profession, and career aspirations.
Additionally, participants provide information on the emotionally connected
object they brought to the workshop and its associated emotion and adjective.
The survey also includes questions about participants’ familiarity with concepts
like haptic prototyping, on-body prototyping, coding, and Affective Haptic De-
sign. This baseline data helps gauge each participant’s starting knowledge and
experience, which is later correlated with their qualitative feedback.

Introduction
1.1
Background of Human-Computer Interaction(HCI) Methodologies
HCI has developed in distinct ”waves,” each of which has been characterized by changes in
research priorities, technological advancements, and societal impacts. This evolution illustrates
the importance of comprehending how methodologies have changed and why it is becoming
important to make accessible research tools for the emerging research fields of Affective Haptics
[18, 37, 47, 57].
The need for accessible and intuitive design methodologies for novice interaction designers in
affective haptic design is highlighted by recent literature, including the affective haptic literature
review by Vyas et al. (2023) [57], the overview of the history of haptic hardware systems
by Seifi et al. (2019) [47], and an overview of recent advancements in the emerging field of
affective haptic design provided Eid and Osman (2016) [18]. These resources underscore the
importance of creating easy-to-understand, context-appropriate methodologies for ethical and
effective affective haptic design.To foster responsible and effective AHSD, novice interaction
designers and researchers need easy-to-understand, context-appropriate methodologies. These
methodologies will ensure that affective haptic systems are ethically designed and reactive to
users’ emotional needs.
This thesis proposes the concept of a modular methodological toolkit for novice interaction de-
signers, drawing on principles such as Haptipedia’s design framework [47], exemplary toolkits
like Haptic Bits Lab’s low-cost haptic prototyping tools1, and Moussette’s ‘Simple Haptics’
design philosophy [37]. Thereby this research addresses the problem of inaccessible affective
haptic design tools by proposing an approach to simplify emotional design and prototyping
processes while maintaining flexibility for individual user contexts. The modular methodologi-
cal toolkit of this thesis draws on these principles to adjust to the fact that single-modal haptic
experiences are highly personal and context-dependent. The toolkit will provide novice interac-
tion designers with a structured approach to acquiring and employing methodologies applicable
to single-modal affective haptic design, including body maps, embodied metaphor elicitation,
Emotion Typology, the complex model of affect, and Experience Prototyping principles. The
application of these methodologies will be taught through a workshop and will also apply to
the design processes of multi-modal systems that include affective haptic feedback. The toolkit
will help them deal with technical challenges and use these methodologies to teach how to de-
sign affective haptic feedback or create affective haptic design systems that can be tested for
emotional impact.
The following sections introduce the historical context of HCI’s development, explore the rele-
vance of Affective Haptics, and outline the need for accessible methodologies for novice inter-
action designers.

1.1.1
First Wave: Cognitive Science, Usability and Efficiency
Cognitive science and human factors engineering significantly created the first wave of HCI,
which took place from the 1980s to the early 1990s. The primary focus during this period
was optimizing the usability and efficiency of technological systems in controlled environ-
ments. Researchers applied meticulous scientific methods to study how users interacted with
command-line interfaces and early graphical user interfaces (GUIs) [8, 9]. These efforts estab-
lished foundational principles for beginner-friendly system design, prioritizing ease of learning,
task efficiency, and error minimization [8, 12].
While the first wave improved usability, it was criticized for being too rigid and task-focused,
neglecting the broader social contexts in which interactions occurred. As computers were intro-
duced to everyday work life, there was a growing recognition that the usability of technological
systems needed to extend beyond controlled, task-based environments and account for more
dynamic social contexts. While the focus of the first wave was primarily on improving usability
through controlled, cognitive studies, it became increasingly clear that more complex environ-
ments and social interactions required new research methodologies and technologies to become
just to the broadened user group with new application contexts [8].
1.1.2
Second Wave: Context and Social Interaction
From 1992 to 2006, the second wave of HCI shifted its focus towards context and social inter-
action. During this period, technology spread into workplaces, homes, and communities, and
researchers began investigating how systems could support collaborative work and group inter-
action. Technologies such as email systems and groupware emerged to support multiple users
working together in shared environments, requiring new methodologies to enhance them with a
scientific basis [6, 8, 9].
• Situated Action (Lucy Suchman, 1987) emphasizes that human actions are context-
dependent and cannot be reliably predicted in isolation. Rather than following predeter-
mined plans, human behavior evolves through dynamic interactions with the environment,
suggesting that technology should accommodate this fluidity [29].
• Distributed Cognition (Ed Hutchins) extends the concept of cognition beyond the indi-
vidual to include interactions with other people and objects in their environment, propos-
ing that information is distributed across people, objects, and tools within an environment.
This theory highlights the importance of designing systems that support collaborative
work environments with shared knowledge [7, 25].
• Activity Theory (Vygotsky and Engestr¨om) focuses on understanding human activities
within social and cultural contexts. It argues that individuals use tools to achieve goals,
which are shaped by the community they belong to. This framework emphasizes the
importance of designing technology that aligns with users’ practices and objectives [7, 9,
19, 58].

These frameworks helped expand HCI’s focus from individual tasks to social systems, encour-
aging the design of more adaptive technologies that support complex human interactions. This
wave also introduced Participatory Design, Co-design, Contextual Inquiry, and Experience Pro-
totyping methodologies, which involve users directly in the design process, ensuring that the
resulting systems fit within their real-world needs and practices [8, 9, 11, 44, 50]. Buchenau
and Suri’s (2000) concept of Experience Prototyping builds on this idea by allowing designers
and users to engage directly with prototypes during the early prototyping process stage, enabling
a more immersive exploration of how a design might feel in practice [11]. This methodolog-
ical approach for the prototyping phase serves as a fundamental basis for this thesis research.
The thesis contribution is in the form of an interactive affective haptic workshop structure con-
centrating on enhancing the prototyping process of affective haptics for novice interaction de-
signers. As introduced by Raven and Flanders (1996), contextual inquiry provided a method
for understanding how users engage with technology in their natural environments, uncovering
insights into behavior and usage patterns that controlled studies could not reveal [44].
However, while participatory design was influential in structured work environments to consider
work-related contexts, the second wave often struggled to accommodate the more spontaneous
and personal uses of technology that emerged with the advent of mobile and ubiquitous com-
puting [8, 13]. This limitation paved the way for the third wave, where individualization and
emotional engagement became central. As Bødker (2015) argues, the third wave of HCI fo-
cuses on experience and meaning-making, but traditional methods often fall short when applied
to non-work contexts and emergent technologies like Affective Haptics [8].
1.1.3
Third Wave: Individualization, Experience, and Emotionally Affective Technolo-
gies
The third wave of HCI, which emerged in the early 2000s, is characterized by a shift towards
experiential and emotional dimensions of interaction (Bødker, 2006, 2015) [8, 9]. This shift
has fostered the rise of Affective Computing and haptics, focusing on how technologies can be
embedded in everyday personal contexts to enhance emotional engagement. It moves beyond
functionality and usability to consider technology as profoundly intertwined with users’ per-
sonal, social, and cultural identities [19]. These experiential, emotional, and aesthetic aspects
of HCI consider how technology can support emotional well-being, personal expression, and
social engagement in recognition that technology is more than just a tool for the workplace but
also a medium that shapes and influences the human experience profoundly on an every-day
basis [8, 21].
The third wave emphasizes individualism and personalization, recognizing that users have
unique needs and emotional responses. This shift has led to the rise of Affective Comput-
ing—designing systems that recognize and respond to users’ emotions, thereby fostering per-
sonalized user experiences that connect on a deeper emotional level. Affective Computing is the
practice of developing systems that can recognize, interpret, and respond to users’ emotional
states. This approach goes beyond the usability focus of earlier technologies, prioritizing how
technology can support personal well-being and emotional engagement. It also includes the re-
search and development of Affective Haptics, which explores how tactile feedback can convey

and invoke emotions, creating tailored and individualized UX.
The increasing use of affective haptic interfaces shows that computational processes are every-
where, not just limited to traditional desktop setups. Affective Haptics open up new possibilities
for enhanced interaction in virtual and remote physical spaces, making use of the limited visual
space available. Current haptic interfaces are mainly designed for desks and are unable to fully
support widespread affective haptic communication. [18].
In the aforementioned context of healthcare, Affective Haptics can play a critical role, lever-
aging the sense of touch to convey emotional information. As technologies like virtual reality,
wearable devices, and immersive interfaces become more prevalent [23, 24], haptics can of-
fer an opportunity to engage users on a deeper emotional level through tactile feedback that
resonates with their personal UXs, which shape their perceptual reality. The third wave’s focus
on embodied interaction and emotional engagement makes haptics an essential area of research,
particularly in the context of Affective Computing. Still, it has yet to be explored and researched
before it can be deployed within everyday technology with effective, personalized intent.
In this context, Affective Haptics emerged as a critical modality for enhancing emotional en-
gagement. As wearable technologies, virtual reality (VR), and immersive interfaces became
more prevalent, the potential for haptics to influence emotional states became clear, offering
users a more personalized, immersive experience [18]. Wearable devices, in particular, are cen-
tral to this development. Gonz´alez Ram´ırez et al. (2023) and Hickey et al. (2021) illustrate how
wearable technologies, through biofeedback systems, are becoming essential tools for moni-
toring stress and emotional well-being, incorporating haptic feedback to regulate physiological
and emotional responses in real-time [23, 24].
Bødker (2015) elaborates on the challenges and opportunities presented by the third wave,
mainly focusing on “rest-of-life technologies” and the expansion of HCI beyond the workplace
into every aspect of daily life. The third wave also brought about new methodological chal-
lenges, as traditional participatory design approaches were questioned for their applicability
to emergent, non-work contexts. Bødker argues for a balance between the individual experi-
ence emphasized by the third wave and the shared, collaborative practices rooted in the second
wave, proposing that HCI must embrace both to address the complexities of modern and future
technology use [8].
To conclude the theoretical context, HCI has evolved significantly from its early focus on op-
timizing user efficiency through cognitive modeling and ergonomics to embracing emotional,
social, and experiential dimensions in recent years. The third wave of HCI highlights the role
of personalization and emotion, positioning Affective Haptics, among other things at the fore-
front of creating meaningful, emotionally affective UXs of the future. This shift also fostered
the rise of Affective Computing, which designs systems capable of recognizing and responding
to users’ emotional states, with haptic feedback offering a potential role in facilitating tailored
affective experiences.
Affective Computing As explored by Tian et al. (2022), Affective Computing is applied across
various domains, from mental health and education to entertainment and human-robot interac-
tion. The core idea is to enable computers and devices to process emotional data in a way that
supports more personalized, adaptive, and human-like interactions. This capability enhances

the UX by making it more intuitive, relatable, and responsive. It opens up new possibilities
for designing real-time affective technological systems that can influence and support users’
emotional well-being in impactful and meaningful ways [54].
1.2
The Role of Haptic Feedback
Haptics refers to the technology that simulates touch and allows users to experience tactile feed-
back through vibrations, pressure, or motion. It is divided into two main types: tactile feedback
and kinesthetic feedback. Tactile feedback involves sensations felt on the skin, such as vibra-
tions, temperature, and texture, while kinesthetic feedback provides information about move-
ment and the forces felt through muscles and joints, offering a sense of weight and resistance
[57]. These systems combine to create multi-dimensional interactions that can enhance user
engagement. MacLean (2022) explores the role of haptics in promoting emotional regulation,
particularly in wellness applications, where personalized haptic stimuli can help users manage
stress and anxiety [34]. As haptic technology evolves, it is increasingly becoming a critical tool
for designing affective interactions across wearables, VR, and immersive environments.
Affective Haptics refers to using tactile feedback to evoke or communicate emotions. The sense
of touch is deeply connected to human emotions, making it a powerful tool for creating more
immersive and emotionally engaging UX. Studies have shown that haptic feedback can convey
a wide range of emotions, from comfort and relaxation to urgency and stress [14, 18, 28, 55].
The Circumplex Model of Affect (Russell, 1980) stems from cognitive sciences and describes
emotions based on two variables on a two-dimensional diagram. This is used in affective haptic
research and development to reduce the complexity of emotions on a 2D matrix [45]. Posner
later argues that emotions are not singular but fluent and multiple emotions can be felt at the
same time [43]. This theory provides a useful framework for haptic designers to map emotions
and translate them into haptic feedback corresponding to specific emotional states. This model
organizes emotions based on valence (pleasure-displeasure categorization of the emotion) on
the X-axis and arousal (activation-deactivation level of the emotion described) on the Y-axis
and designers can design tactile stimuli with a corresponding emotional response more easily.
By mapping haptic stimuli to this model, designers can categorize haptic stimuli into emotional
representations and, thus, could create tactile feedback that can evoke emotions like calmness,
excitement, or anxiety [28, 43, 45].
Recent developments in haptic technology research, such as those looked at by Swindells et
al. (2014), allow for guidelines and exploration of rapid prototyping and experimentation with
vibrotactile effects, facilitating the creation of emotionally engaging feedback systems [52].
Despite its potential, designing affective haptic feedback presents unique challenges, particu-
larly for novice interaction designers who may not have experience with the technical and emo-
tional nuances of haptic technology, human touch perception, and their correlated emotional
response. Haptics encompass an interdisciplinary approach involving biomechanics, psychol-
ogy, neurophysiology, engineering, and computer science, focusing on the exploration of human
touch and force feedback within the context of contemporary HCI [18]. The technical complex-

ity of haptic devices, combined with the subjectivity of emotional experiences, makes it difficult
to design functional and emotionally meaningful single-modal affective haptic systems.
1.3
Problem Statement: The Need for a Modular Methodological Toolkit
for Novice Interaction Designers
As the field of HCI expands to incorporate more affective and empathetically reactive technolo-
gies [1, 3, 18, 57], there is a growing need for tools that enable designers — especially those
new to haptic interaction design — to effectively integrate haptic feedback into their projects.
Novice interaction designers often struggle with the challenges of mastering the technical as-
pects of haptic systems and translating abstract, subjective emotional concepts into tangible
feedback. This is further complicated by the lack of accessible, beginner-friendly hardware
toolkits and accessible methodological resources and guidelines that could facilitate these com-
plex thought and design processes.
The complexity of current haptic toolkits - whether it be hardware, software or methodological
toolkits -, which frequently require technical mastery over emotional design thinking, results in
a lack of accessible resources for novice interaction designers (Vyas et al., 2023) [57]. Spinuzzi
(2005) emphasizes the importance of participatory methods, suggesting that novice designers
benefit from practical, user-centered tools that bridge advanced technology with accessible de-
sign approaches [51]. This toolkit aims to provide such a bridge, simplifying the prototyping of
subjective single-modal affective haptic feedback through embodied design principles to teach
affective haptic design to novice interaction designers.
While there are several toolkits for haptic design, many are geared toward haptic engineering,
or computer science experts, and focus mainly on technical aspects such as actuator control and
signal processing. novice interaction designers, especially those without a deep understanding
of haptics, coding, or engineering principles, often struggle to translate abstract emotional con-
cepts into concrete single-modal affective haptic feedback for user testing. In addition, existing
resources usually lack support for iterative testing and emotional guidance, which are crucial
for developing affective haptic feedback systems(AHFS) that achieve the intended emotional
impact. To address this issue, the proposed toolkit will provide simplified methodological re-
sources to guide designers through their design processes. It will offer materials to support
ideation, prototyping, and user testing, integrating technical and emotional considerations ef-
fectively.
Recent innovations like the Haptic Bits Lab have demonstrated how accessible, low-cost haptic
prototyping tools can enable rapid experimentation in haptic feedback design. By offering an
intuitive and modular approach, projects such as these support novice interaction designers in
exploring the possibilities of haptic technology without a requirement for extensive technical
expertise2

interaction) affective haptic systems, concepts from Soma Design, embodied metaphor elici-

tation, Emotion Typology, the Circumplex Model of Affect and Experience Prototyping were
introduced and combined in a workshop procedure to help simplify the approaching efforts for
affective haptic feedback design processes.
To address these challenges, this thesis proposes a modular toolkit designed to guide novice
interaction designers through the process of creating single-modal (i.e. only haptic stimulus
as interaction) AHFS. Drawing on methodologies such as Soma Design [15, 56], embodied
metaphor elicitation [5], and the Circumplex Model of Affect [43, 45], this toolkit simplifies the
emotional design process by providing a novel approach for combining the theoretical frame-
works. The Emotion Typology from TU Delft further aids in breaking down complex emotional
states into their core components of valence and arousal, helping designers align their haptic
designs with intended emotional responses [20]. By using these frameworks, novice interac-
tion designers can develop a structured approach to translating abstract emotions into concrete,
testable haptic feedback.
1.4
Research Questions and Hypothesis
The primary purpose of this thesis is to develop and test a comprehensive methodological toolkit
designed to support novice interaction designers in creating affective haptic feedback. The
toolkit leverages existing design methodologies including embodied metaphor elicitation, the
Circumplex Model of Affect, and Experience Prototyping to provide novice designers with
structured, accessible approaches to creating affective haptic systems. The methods in this
toolkit were chosen to make single-modal affective haptic design more accessible by creating
and combining beginner-friendly resources, guidelines, and methodologies that guide designers
through their design process to integrate suitable approaches to affective haptic feedback into
their projects. The core of the toolkit builds upon existing frameworks and tools, including the
Circumplex Model of Affect (Russell, 1980) [45], embodied metaphors (Bakker et al., 2012)
[5], body mapping (Turmo Vidal et al., 2023) [56], and Experience Prototyping (Buchenau and
Suri, 2000) [11], adapting them to suit novice designers’ needs. In order to gather feedback
about the toolkit, an Affective Haptics workshop was conducted, focusing on the emotional
dimensions of a personal object that participants brought and were tasked to translate it with a
tandem partner into a haptic interaction. The toolkit seeks to enhance the quality and useful-
ness of single-modal haptic feedback to make them applicable for multi-modal affective haptic
interfaces, enabling designers to create more empathetic and user-centered experiences.
This research is guided by the following key questions:
• RQ1: What is the impact of using embodied metaphors in combination with body maps
on the design and communication process of affective haptic feedback for novice interac-
tion designers?
• RQ2: How can Lo-Fi on-body Tandem prototyping sessions with haptic feedback be
structured to elicit valuable insights into emotional responses from users?
• RQ3: What specific challenges do novice interaction designers encounter when integrat-
ing haptic feedback into Lo-Fi on-body prototype design concepts?

• RQ4: What tools and methodologies are needed to make on-body affective haptic proto-
typing accessible to novice interaction designers?
The specific objectives of this research are as follows:
• To facilitate the design and prototyping of emotionally affective haptic systems by pro-

reduce technical barriers for novice interaction designers.

Contribution of the Thesis
The significance of this thesis lies in its potential to make affective haptic design and research
assessible by providing useful resources for novice interaction designers, making it easier to
develop AHFS. As Frauenberger (2019) argues, the third wave of HCI emphasizes the entan-
glement of emotional, social, and cultural dimensions in technology design, making tools that
support these aspects crucial for future developments in HCI [21]. The interpretation of a stim-
ulus is highly dependent on context, and the interpretation can vary significantly based on the
social, cultural, and environmental factors surrounding the interaction [18, 36]. This is espe-
cially true for haptic stimuli, as the meaning of touch has vastly different meanings depending
on our cultural upbringing. Designing systems that can consistently communicate emotions

across different contexts and cultures remains a major challenge in the field of Affective Hap-
tics, particularly when considering the aforementioned cross-cultural differences in touch-based
human communication. At present, there is no effective Affective Haptics repository available.
The design of an effective Affective Haptics system relies on successful emotion induction.
To address this, research and design of AHFS must be made accessible and a novel Affec-
tive Haptics database must be created to increase the availability of predictable haptic emotion
stimuli. This database would store carefully chosen haptic patterns that elicit and/or display
different emotions and can inform design decisions for future projects in affective haptic feed-
back design. Essentially, a database for successful emotion induction in Affective Haptics is
still undiscovered [18].
By addressing these dimensions, the study contributes to the advancement of HCI by fostering
more empathetic, user-centered affective haptic design practices. By enhancing the learning
process of novice interaction designers to create single-modal emotionally affective haptic in-
teractions, respecting the revised version of Engestr¨om’s ”Learning by expanding(2015)” [19],
the methodological approaches of the proposed modular toolkit also have the potential to im-
prove the overall quality of haptic UXs across various applications, from wearable devices to
immersive virtual environments.
To summarize, HCI branched from cognitive usability studies among other things into more ex-
periential and emotion-centered designs. This transformation reflects the growing recognition
that technology supports functional tasks and shapes emotional and social experiences. As the
third wave of HCI emphasizes emotional engagement and personalization, Affective Haptics —
using tactile feedback to evoke and communicate emotions — has emerged as a critical research
area. However, despite its potential, affective haptic design is still a complex and novel field
and remains inaccessible to many novice interaction designers due to its technical complexity
and the lack of beginner-friendly methodological frameworks. To address this gap, this thesis
proposes a modular toolkit that simplifies the design of affective haptic systems, drawing on key
theories and tools from HCI’s evolution. The goal is to make affective haptic design more acces-
sible, particularly by offering beginner-friendly methods for prototyping, iteration, and testing
which can be expanded into the realm of multi-modal feedback after learning the principles
for single-modal haptic stimuli. By leveraging tools like emotion typologies, the Circumplex
Model of Affect, body map sheets, embodied metaphor elicitation sheets, and no-coding haptic
prototyping kits (i.e., Hapticlabs DevKit & Studio Software3), this thesis proposes a variety
of methodological approaches with which designers will be equipped to explore affective hap-
tic technologies without requiring deep technical expertise. By addressing current research
gaps and providing accessible methodologies, this work contributes to the ongoing evolution
of HCI, laying the groundwork for future innovations in affective haptic wearable technologies
and beyond. The following section provides a detailed overview of related work, exploring the
development of Affective Haptics and the design frameworks that inform the proposed toolkit.

2.1
Emotional Design and User Experience
The importance of emotions in design has been extensively discussed by Norman (2004) in
his seminal work Emotional Design: Why We Love (or Hate) Everyday Things [40]. Norman
posits that successful products must appeal not only on a functional level but also engage users
on visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels. He introduces the concept of emotional design,
emphasizing that designers should consider the emotional responses their products evoke in
users. This perspective is crucial in the context of affective haptic design, where the objective
of the product device is to elicit specific emotional reactions in a user through tactile feedback.
Researchers and developers of affective haptic design should therefore be very considerate of
the ethical impact they have on the user’s emotional state they design for.
Norman’s framework categorizes emotional responses into three levels:
• Visceral Level: Relates to the initial impact of a design, its appearance, feel, and sound.
• Behavioral Level: Concerns the usability and function of the product.
• Reflective Level: Involves the user’s personal satisfaction, memories, and the meanings
attached to the product.
By understanding these levels, designers can create products that not only meet functional re-
quirements but also resonate emotionally with users. In affective haptic design, this means
developing tactile feedback that can induce emotional experiences aligned with the user’s needs
and contexts.
Norman’s emphasis on user-centered design aligns with the goals of our proposed methodolog-
ical toolkit. By integrating emotional considerations into the design process, novice designers
can create more engaging and meaningful haptic interactions. This approach supports the need
for tools and methodologies that facilitate the articulation, translation, and prototyping of emo-
tional experiences, which are central to AHFS.
Furthermore, Norman’s work highlights the subjective nature of emotional responses, reinforc-
ing the importance of iterative design and user feedback.

Affective Haptics and Emotional Engagement
2.2.1
Affective Haptics
Vyas et al. (2023), who examined more than 110 papers from significant venues in HCI, Affec-
tive Computing, and haptics research, stated affective haptic system design(AHSD) has rapidly
evolved over the past ten years. This analysis highlights not only the growing interdisciplinary
nature of AHSD but also key advancements in understanding the relationship between touch and
emotion, focusing on areas such as emotion regulation, body awareness, and bio-sensing [57].
While this literature overview highlights the potential of Affective Haptics, novice interaction
designers still lack accessible tools that bridge the gap between these theoretical advancements
and practical implementation. According to Vyas et al. (2023) and Eid and Al Osman (2016)
[18], Affective Haptics will become a critical component of HCI by not only eliciting emo-
tions but also enhancing the emotional depth of communication. Ju et al. (2021) and Schoeller
(2023) have demonstrated that combining vibrotactile feedback with visual or auditory cues
significantly enhances emotional communication, further supporting the role of multimodal in-
teraction in Affective Haptics [28, 46]. Unlike unimodal cues, such as auditory or visual signals,
multimodal haptic stimuli, including touch, evoke a stronger emotional response. According to
Christensen (2015), emotional communication gains credibility and intensity when delivered
through multiple sensory modalities, particularly in close proximity social contexts [14].
2.2.2
Emotional Framework for Affective Haptic Design
Central to the design of Affective Haptics is Russell’s Circumplex Model of Affect, which orga-
nizes emotions along two axes: valence (positive-negative) and arousal (high-low) [45]. Build-
ing on Russell’s work, Posner et al. (2005) expanded this framework, arguing that emotions
should be viewed as fluid rather than discrete, meaning individuals can experience multiple
emotions simultaneously. This nuance in emotional modeling is critical for haptic designers,
who must account for the complexity and overlap of emotional experiences when crafting tactile
feedback. The Posner theory of Russell’s Circumplex Model of Affect enables haptic systems
to produce stimuli that capture this emotional depth, particularly in immersive environments
where haptic feedback can convey more than one emotional state at a time [43].
Incorporating the Circumplex Model of Affect into haptic design enables designers to categorize
emotions effectively by valence and arousal. Research by Ju et al. (2021) have shown that
vibrotactile feedback can serve as an effective medium for expressing a wide range of emotions.
Their findings suggest that vibrotactile feedback offers universal cues for emotional recognition,
with higher accuracy in emotions such as joy and anger [28].
This theoretical cognitive model is frequently used by the Affective Haptic Design community
to better translate emotions into suitable haptic feedback, which informs the direction of the
haptic design to elicit specific emotional reactions. Pinpointing an area and sorting the desired
UX on the matrix makes it easier to identify the general direction of expected emotional impact
and haptic design properties. As previously said, the actual interpretation of feedback remains

highly personal and application context-dependent, yet this approach directs the design already
in a certain direction.
Similarly, Tsetserukou et al. (2009) emphasized that combining haptic stimuli with visual cues
significantly enhances emotional communication, reinforcing the role of multimodal interac-
tion in Affective Haptics [55]. Schoeller (2023) also explored how haptic feedback can be
aligned with specific emotional states, further highlighting how the sense of touch can facilitate
emotional communication in immersive environments [46]. These studies demonstrate how Af-
fective Haptics can enable deeper emotional engagement in digital interactions. While studies
like Ju et al. (2021) and Schoeller (2023) explore the potential of vibrotactile feedback for emo-
tional engagement, novice interaction designers require tools that facilitate rapid iteration for
affective haptic feedback design.
Moussette (2012) presents a ‘sketching’ approach for simple haptics, enabling rapid prototyping
and intuitive design iterations. This method significantly lowers the barrier for novice interac-
tion designers, allowing them to quickly experiment with different tactile interactions without
deep technical expertise [37]. Israr et al. (2014) further explore how haptic feedback can enrich
narrative storytelling, demonstrating the potential of haptic stimuli to create emotionally engag-
ing experiences, especially in entertainment or immersive environments like virtual reality and
gaming [26].
Technological advancements like artificial intelligence (AI) and faster computing systems have
broadened the potential for haptic design. Platforms like Haptipedia provide a comprehensive
catalog of haptic technology and when it was developed, aiding designers in understanding,
discovering, and selecting appropriate haptic hardware for their research efforts [47]. Further,
Eid and Al Osman (2016) emphasize the role of haptic feedback in enhancing social commu-
nication, particularly for visually impaired users, showing how Affective Haptics can improve
accessibility and inclusive design [18].
In line with Walter (2011), the role of emotional interaction in design is crucial for creating
meaningful UXs. Affective Haptics, by leveraging the sense of touch, can offer a direct way to
evoke and communicate emotions in digital environments. This supports the growing focus on
emotional engagement in HCI [59].
My recent work and publication at the Eurohaptic Conference 2024 (G¨oke et al. (2024)) demon-
strate how Affective Haptics could influence emotional states, particularly in fostering relax-
ation through real-time haptic feedback that slows down and becomes less frequent to lower
the breath rate and thus inducing guided relaxation. Our ongoing research indicates how users
can respond emotionally to presumably affective haptic feedback, and how this feedback can
be fine-tuned through iterative design to achieve successful affective state changes with single-
modal haptic interactions [22].
2.3
Emotion Typology and the Circumplex Model
To guide the emotional responses elicited through haptic feedback, the Emotion Typology from
TU Delft offers a structured approach to understanding and categorizing emotions [20]. This

typology was used to help participants elicit specific emotions and help non-native English
speakers to express themselves better about emotional states. The Circumplex Model of Af-
fect organizes emotions along two axes — valence (positive-negative) and arousal (high-low)
— offering a framework for mapping emotional experiences to haptic feedback [43, 45]. As
demonstrated by Ju et al. (2021) [28], this methodology was already used to map emotions
to inform haptic feedback. In my workshop participants could use a combination of both to
then map the chosen emotion from the Emotion Typology into the 2D matrix of the Circum-
plex Model of Affect, simplifying emotional states into their valence and arousal levels. By
breaking down complex emotions into simpler components using this typology, novice interac-
tion designers can more easily align their haptic designs with the desired emotional responses.
The connection of these models forms the basis for the emotional mapping exercises within the
proposed toolkit, aimed at enabling novice interaction designers to align tactile feedback with
specific emotional states during the design process.
By integrating the Emotion Typology from TU Delft, which categorizes emotions by their core
components, the toolkit allows novice interaction designers to align haptic design decisions
with emotional states systematically. These models provide a foundation for translating abstract
emotions into tactile feedback, ensuring emotional resonance in haptic interactions.
2.4
Wearable Technologies for Mental Wellness
Wearable technologies have rapidly evolved into sophisticated biofeedback systems capable of
monitoring a range of physiological signals like heart rate variability (HRV), electrodermal ac-
tivity (EDA), and respiratory patterns. These metrics can offer real-time feedback for managing
stress and emotional well-being through haptic stimulation [3]. Gonz´alez Ram´ırez et al. (2023)
provide a comprehensive review of these technologies, emphasizing their potential for stress
management through biofeedback integration. This review identifies key advancements in how
wearables leverage emotional data to enhance user well-being in real-time [23], opening up
the possibility for haptic based stress interventions. Similaritly, Hickey et al. (2021) investi-
gate the utility of wearable technology in the diagnosis and treatment of mental health issues,
highlighting the significant advantages of haptic and auditory feedback systems in effective
individualized approaches to anxiety and stress management [24].
Drawing the connection to haptics, MacLean (2022) explores how affective haptic feedback can
be designed to support emotional well-being, particularly within wellness-focused applications.
The study examines the use of haptic feedback as a tool for emotional regulation, suggesting
that wearable technologies utilizing haptics can create calming, soothing sensations to help
users manage stress and anxiety. Integrating personalized haptic feedback into wellness appli-
cations, such as meditation aids or stress-relief wearables, demonstrates the potential of these
systems to provide real-time emotional support [34]. Such systems allow users to engage with
their emotions in real-time, promoting greater self-awareness and emotional regulation through
physical sensations [55]. This aligns with Hickey et al. (2021), who illustrates how wearable
haptic technologies are increasingly used in mental health contexts, integrating biofeedback
mechanisms for individualized stress and anxiety management [24].

As AI or any biofeedback model needs labeled data to reliably detect the emotional states of
individuals with varying biosignal strengths, Tazarv et al. (2021) investigated the potential
of personalized biofeedback systems to adjust to users’ emotional and physiological states in
real-time, providing targeted stress management interventions for everyday use. This study
paves the way for future research into more advanced labeling strategies that may allow for
context-aware, indivisualized models, which in turn will enable health professionals to offer
more tailored interventions [53].
Alvarsson et al. (2010) studied the therapeutic effects of natural sounds on participants in
stress recovery, suggesting that integrating auditory biofeedback with haptics could enhance
the effectiveness of wearables for mental health interventions [4]. Since haptic feedback often
uses soundwaves delivered via “voice-coil actuators,” there is potential for sound and haptic
feedback to work together in promoting relaxation and emotional regulation. Combining haptic,
auditory, and visual feedback improves the ability of wearables to offer personalized, multi-
modal interventions for managing stress and anxiety [2, 35].
Multi-modal feedback systems, which can combine haptic, auditory, and visual stimuli, offer
significant potential for creating more immersive UXs. Kim et al. (2024) explore the synchro-
nization of haptic and auditory cues through cross-modal pitch matching, demonstrating how
combining sound and touch enhances users’ emotional engagement, especially in music ther-
apy and stress relief applications [30]. Jo et al. (2019) provided insights into how nature-based
stimuli, such as auditory and visual inputs from forest environments, influence psychological
well-being [27]. The exposure to natural environment stimuli can positively influence psycho-
logical and physiological well-being suggests that combining these stimuli with haptic feedback
— such as gentle vibrations or the sensation of walking in the forest or a sensation of wind —
could enhance wearable devices’ effectiveness in regulating emotions. Integrating these nature-
based stimuli with haptic biofeedback offers promising opportunities for stress management
in mental wellness applications. Furthermore, this multi-modal emotional regulation research
could be especially valuable in contributing valuable knowledge to the under explored applica-
tion of Affective Haptic Design principles.
As biofeedback technology improves, adding artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms will let
wearables better predict how people are feeling and customize multi-modal feedback inter-
ventions based on real-time physiological data [1].
This approach could provide novel technologies that support users in situations where conven-
tional self-regulation methods are not available (i.e., going for a walk, working out), depending
on the context of use (i.e., an office meeting, workday stress monitoring).
Additionally, AI-driven biofeedback is increasingly enhancing immersive feedback systems.
Advanced wearables equipped with AI could predict emotional states based on real-time data.
This would open the possibility to provide highly personalized intervention mechanisms tailored
to the user’s emotional and physiological context ultimately supporting their mental health in
real-time.
As biofeedback systems become more sophisticated, the role of haptics in wearable technol-
ogy will continue to grow, offering real-time emotional interventions through tactile feedback
systems designed for stress management and emotional regulation yielding the potential for

Design Frameworks and Toolkits Useful for Affective Haptic Design
LoFi Prototyping & Haptic Design Guidelines
Designing affective haptic systems is com-
plex due to the need to balance technical constraints with emotional interaction, making the
development of accessible toolkits essential for novice interaction designers. In this regard,
Breitschaft et al. (2022) propose the Haptic Fidelity Framework, which classifies haptic sys-
tems based on their ability to convey perceptual effects, rather than purely on mechanical pre-
cision. This framework introduces three fidelity levels — low (LoFi), medium (MidFi), and
high-fidelity (HiFi) — allowing designers to match their system’s capabilities to the emotional
engagement they intend to evoke.
LoFi systems, such as simple vibrations, are useful for notification-based designs, offering
straightforward feedback. Medium-fidelity systems simulate mechanical interactions, like but-
ton clicks, with more detail, while high-fidelity systems enable rich, immersive sensations, such
as textures or material properties, crucial in virtual reality (VR) and automotive applications.
This framework is particularly helpful for novice interaction designers by providing a struc-
tured guide to choosing the appropriate technology based on the desired emotional outcomes.
By integrating this into their design process, novice interaction designers can match feedback
fidelity to their project’s emotional and technical requirements, enhancing both the UX and the
system’s emotional engagement [10].
The SkinKit construction toolkit developed by Ku et al. (2022) represents a significant ad-
vancement in simplifying the development of on-skin interfaces. SkinKit offers a low-barrier,
plug-and-play approach, making it easier for designers — particularly those without advanced
technical expertise — to experiment with on-body interactions. The toolkit enables rapid, low-
fidelity prototyping through flexible, skin-conformable modules, which are directly applicable
to the skin. This approach is crucial for affective haptic design, where designers need to quickly
iterate on prototypes and test haptic feedback on the body to ensure emotional resonance [31].
The ability to quickly deploy functional on-skin prototypes and receive real-time feedback ac-
celerates the prototyping process, making it ideal for novice interaction designers working with
Affective Haptics.
In a follow-up to SkinKit, Ku et al. (2023) introduced SkinLink, which further enhances the
flexibility and adaptability of on-skin interface construction. SkinLink allows users to pro-
totype reconfigurable epidermal interfaces directly on the body, addressing the challenge of
iterating designs in situ. For affective haptic designers, SkinLink offers an intuitive, beginner-
friendly toolkit that adapts to dynamic and non-planar body surfaces, enabling them to create
haptic feedback systems that respond to emotional states in real-time. The system’s modular
approach, combined with its focus on skin conformability and ease of modification, provides
novice interaction designers with a powerful tool to rapidly prototype and test emotional haptic
interactions on different body locations [32].
The SkinKit and SkinLink systems also support multi-modal feedback systems, combining hap-
tic, visual, and auditory stimuli, which are essential for creating immersive and emotionally

engaging user experiences. For instance, in affective haptic design, combining haptic feedback
with other sensory modalities can deepen emotional engagement, particularly in applications
such as mental wellness and stress management [31, 32]. These modular systems allow design-
ers to explore different sensory combinations, facilitating the creation of more holistic emotional
experiences.
In Moussette (2012), the concept of “simple haptics” is introduced to lower the complexity of
haptic design by providing basic tools and frameworks that encourage experimentation with
haptic stimuli. This method allows for an iterative design process where designers can fre-
quently test and refine their work based on feedback, making it particularly valuable for novice
interaction designers who may lack deep technical expertise but still wish to create affective
haptic feedback [37].
The formentioned toolkits by Ku et al. (2022, 2023) align with Moussette’s (2012) ”simple hap-
tics” concept, which emphasizes lowering the complexity of haptic design through basic tools
and frameworks that encourage frequent experimentation with haptic stimuli. Both SkinKit and
SkinLink reflect this philosophy by offering modular, reconfigurable systems that simplify com-
plex design processes. By adopting this rapid, Lo-Fi prototyping approach, novice interaction
designers can more easily test how different feedback patterns evoke specific emotions without
becoming bogged down in technical complexities. These toolkits enable novice interaction de-
signers to focus on emotional affect, iterating quickly to ensure that the haptic feedback they
create aligns with the user’s emotional experience.
Building on this idea, Moussette (2012) also proposes the concept of “sketching haptics,” which
emphasizes quick, Lo-Fi experimentation. By treating haptic design similarly to how visual de-
signers sketch, this approach encourages designers to prototype tactile interactions using simple
tools, enabling rapid iterations. The focus is on how different feedback patterns evoke specific
emotions rather than on technical complexities. Through this iterative experimentation, design-
ers can align their haptic systems more effectively with user emotions and responses [38]. By
offering these ‘sketching’ tools to novice interaction designers, the proposed toolkit can sim-
plify complex design processes, enabling early prototyping and quick testing, which is crucial
for understanding how users emotionally respond to haptic feedback.
In addition to creating affective haptic feedback, ensuring comfort and realism is critical in de-
signing haptic devices. Shor et al. (2018) compare two VR gloves and emphasize that user
comfort, along with the haptic feedback quality, is crucial for maintaining immersion in virtual
environments. Their study highlights the trade-offs between performance, comfort, and realism
in designing haptic devices [48], which aligns with the need for novice interaction designers
to consider both emotional and ergonomic factors when already developing LoFi haptic pro-
totypes. This work emphasizes the importance of well-designed, immersive haptic feedback
being both technically accurate and comfortable for prolonged use which has implications for
wearable technology development in healthcare as well.
Embodied Metaphor Elicitation
Embodied metaphors provide a powerful framework for
translating abstract concepts into intuitive, physical interactions. As Bakker et al. (2012) em-
phasize, embodied metaphors leverage human experiences of physical movement to make sense


============================================================

18
of abstract concepts in tangible interaction design. Their work highlights how metaphorical
mappings between input actions (e.g., physical movements) and output responses can enhance
interaction design [5]. While the original study focuses on tangible interactions, the iterative,
user-centered design approach proposed in their work — starting with enactment studies and
moving through Lo-Fi prototypes to validate metaphors — provides a valuable structure for
designers.
In the context of Affective Haptics, this thesis extends Bakker’s framework to suggest that
embodied metaphors can inform the creation of emotionally affective haptic feedback patterns.
By using embodied metaphors, novice interaction designers can map physical sensations onto
abstract emotional states. For example, a “warm, soft touch” could represent comfort, while a
“sharp, quick vibration” might indicate urgency. Although Bakker’s work does not explicitly
focus on haptic feedback, the idea of using embodied schemata — cognitive structures derived
from sensorimotor experiences — can be adapted to design haptic feedback that resonates with
users’ emotions [17, 39].
Daud´en Roquet and Sas (2021) take this further by exploring embodied metaphors in medita-
tion, focusing on interoceptive interactions. They demonstrate how metaphors can map bodily
sensations, such as warmth, to meditation states like mindfulness or mind-wandering. This ap-
proach emphasizes the potential of using metaphor-inspired haptic feedback to influence emo-
tional regulation, a key area for affective haptic design. By integrating thermal feedback, the
authors show that interoceptive experiences can deepen emotional engagement and attention
regulation, thus extending metaphorical mappings beyond traditional sensory modalities [17].
This insight is particularly relevant for Affective Haptics, as it suggests that novice interaction
designers could use embodied metaphors to map emotional experiences directly onto bodily
sensations such as heat, pressure, or vibration.
Nardon and Hari (2021) further elaborate on the power of Imaginative Metaphor Elicitation
(IME) to generate deep introspective understanding in participants. They found that metaphors
help individuals articulate and make sense of complex, non-tangible experiences, facilitating a
renewed sense of empowerment and self-awareness. This aligns well with the goals of affec-
tive haptic design, where metaphorical mappings can help users and designers bridge abstract
emotional states with physical feedback mechanisms. IME’s emphasis on introspection and
empowerment also supports novice interaction designers in Affective Haptics, providing them
with a structured yet intuitive method for eliciting meaningful emotional responses from users
[39].
Thus, while Bakker et al. (2012) demonstrate that embodied metaphors facilitate the translation
of abstract concepts into intuitive physical interaction design, this thesis builds on their work to
propose that embodied metaphors can help to teach novice interaction designers how to create
single-modal affective haptic feedback patterns that affect the emotional state within specified
user contexts.
Additionally taking into account the imaginative metaphor work by Daud´en Roquet and Sas, as
well as Nardon and Hari suggests that metaphors could allow designers to elicit rich, meaningful
user experiences by applying them with somatic and emotional states. This is particularly valu-
able for designing single-modal Affective Haptics where designers must translate subjective,

often nuanced emotional experiences into concrete haptic stimuli.
By incorporating these methodologies, the proposed toolkit applies embodied metaphor elici-
tation as a core component in affective haptic interaction design education. novice interaction
designers can use these techniques to map user emotions correlated with an object onto haptic
feedback systems, ensuring that the metaphors not only capture the essence of the emotional ex-
perience but also evoke a similar emotional resonance in users. In this way, embodied metaphor
elicitation becomes a useful tool for enhancing the emotional effectiveness of haptic feedback
systems designed by novice interaction designers.
Body Maps
Cochrane et al. (2022) and Turmo Vidal et al. (2023) discuss body maps as
a generative tool for capturing somatic experiences and emotions. Body maps allow users to
visually document complex and non-explicit emotions by marking body parts that are physically
and emotionally significant during specific interactions [15, 56]. In Affective Haptic Design,
body maps can be particularly useful for identifying where emotional and tactile experiences
converge. By mapping out where users physically feel emotions such as anxiety, calm, or stress,
designers can create haptic feedback systems that target specific areas of the body, enhancing
the emotional impact of haptic interactions.
Nummenmaa et al. (2014) extend this concept by revealing distinct bodily sensation maps
associated with a wide range of emotions. Their research shows that emotions such as happi-
ness, fear, and anger consistently activate distinct bodily regions, which are culturally universal
across West European and East Asian populations. For instance, happiness induces heightened
sensations across the entire body, while fear predominantly activates the chest and upper body
[41]. These findings provide a solid empirical foundation for the use of body maps in affective
haptic design, as they offer insight into how different emotions are somatically experienced and
how these patterns can be translated into tactile feedback.
The flexibility of body maps allows designers to record patterns of bodily sensations during in-
teractions, which can guide the development of haptic devices that respond to these sensations.
For example, tracking changes in bodily experience over time could be crucial when designing
haptic wearables that assist in real-time emotional regulation. Additionally, body maps can sup-
port the development of multi-modal feedback systems by integrating touch with other sensory
inputs, such as sound or visual stimuli, to create more holistic emotional experiences.
This generative potential of body maps makes them an ideal tool for novice interaction designers
working with Affective Haptics. By capturing users’ somatic experiences, body maps offer
insights into how haptic feedback could be personalized to evoke or modulate specific emotional
states. The work by Nummenmaa et al. further reinforces the role of somatic feedback in
emotional regulation and suggests that monitoring these bodily sensations could offer valuable
input for designing emotionally affective haptic systems [41]. In the proposed toolkit, body
maps could be used to prototype and evaluate the emotional effectiveness of different haptic
designs, ensuring that the feedback aligns with users’ bodily and emotional responses.
In addition to these frameworks, projects like the Haptic Bits Lab4 demonstrate how acces-

sible, modular prototyping kits can facilitate hands-on experimentation for novice interaction
designers, lowering the barriers to creating affective haptic systems.
2.6
Future Directions in Affective Haptic Design
The integration of haptic feedback with other sensory modalities, such as visual, auditory, and
olfactory cues, is a promising direction for future research. Vyas et al. (2023) highlight the
potential for combining multiple sensory channels to create more immersive and emotionally
engaging UXs [57]. For instance, the combination of tactile feedback with visual or auditory
cues in virtual reality environments can make digital interactions feel more realistic and emo-
tionally immersive.
Underlining this statement, Shor et al. (2021) explore the potential of multi-modal systems
in creating emotionally affective experiences through the ‘Resonance Pod,’ a multisensory in-
stallation combining haptics, sound, and light to promote relaxation. The study demonstrates
how haptic feedback, when synchronized with visual and auditory stimuli, can enhance emo-
tional regulation, particularly in stress and anxiety management. This highlights the potential
of multi-modal feedback systems in wearable technologies for mental wellness, where emo-
tional engagement can be enhanced through cross-modal integration [49]. The success of such
systems underscores the importance of integrating multi-modal cues for novice interaction de-
signers seeking to design for emotional well-being.
Haptic feedback’s potential for cross-modal interaction, such as the combination of sound and
touch, has also been explored by Kim et al. (2024), who demonstrated that cross-modal pitch
matching can enhance how users perceive tactile stimuli. This integration allows for richer
emotional engagement by synchronizing haptic feedback with auditory cues, particularly in
applications like music therapy and stress relief [30].
The future of Affective Haptics lies in its potential to revolutionize interpersonal communi-
cation. Ju et al. (2021) explored how vibrotactile feedback could convey emotions such as
empathy and support, offering users a tactile means of expressing complex emotional states
[28]. Tsetserukou et al. (2009) proposed an affective haptic system, ”iFeel IM!”, that enhances
emotional communication in virtual environments by simulating real-world social touch, such
as hugs, through haptic devices [55].
Affective Haptics research has increasingly drawn upon interdisciplinary collaboration, involv-
ing experts from fields such as neuroscience, psychology, and engineering. This collaboration
has led to significant advancements in haptic feedback design and evaluation, with new insights
into how touch influences emotional states. With the integration of diverse methodologies,
researchers started to address complex issues, such as emotional regulation and bio-sensing,
through more robust haptic systems [57]. Research in Affective Haptics has increasingly fo-
cused on emotion regulation, with many systems designed to help users manage stress and
anxiety through biofeedback and tactile stimuli. Vyas et al. (2023) also note that over 50% of
the recent studies in AHSD have explored how haptics can be used to support emotional regula-
tion, emphasizing the potential of these systems for mental health interventions. The evaluation

of affective haptic systems has primarily focused on non-clinical, lab-based studies, with lim-
ited real-world or clinical trials. While non-clinical evaluations are important for early-stage
development, there is a critical need for more rigorous, clinically validated studies. This would
ensure that affective haptic devices can effectively support emotional regulation and mental
health interventions in real-world settings. These gaps underscore the need for more robust
evaluation methods, particularly in clinical and real-world environments, to assess the impact
and effectiveness of haptic devices in long-term emotional regulation [57].
This speaks for a growing need for advanced prototyping tools that enable real-time iteration
and testing of AHSD. These tools would allow designers to refine haptic feedback based on im-
mediate user feedback, making it easier to create emotionally effective haptic systems. As these
tools evolve, they will lower barriers for novice interaction designers, enabling more efficient
and user-centered design processes.
2.7
Prototyping and Real-Time Iteration
By enabling users and designers to actively engage with interactive haptic on-body prototype
processes in real-world contexts (i.e. the interaction with their emotional object), Experience
Prototyping, which Buchenau and Suri (2000) introduced, expands on participatory design
[11] that suits the purpose of this workshop. This method in combination with the embod-
ied metaphor elicitation [5] and body mapping techniques from Soma Design [15, 41] is critical
for exploring complex systems where emotional and social interactions are central. By immers-
ing users in tangible experiences, it becomes possible to capture the nuances of user emotions
and interactions connected to their chosen object. In the context of Affective Haptics, Experi-
ence Prototyping allows for the rapid testing and refinement of emotionally affective feedback,
ensuring that the emotional impact of haptic interactions is aligned with UXs in real-time en-
vironments. By following their example to focus on Low-Fidelity (LoFi) prototypes to convey
concepts faster instead of focusing on the technical feasibility, this workshop emphasizes the
importance of rapid iteration and user feedback. Low-fidelity (LoFi) prototypes enable partici-
pants to quickly explore different haptic feedback patterns and adjust them based on real-time
user reactions. This approach fosters creativity and flexibility, allowing designers to focus on
emotional resonance rather than technical constraints. The iterative cycles, in which partici-
pants alternated between the roles of designer and user, promoted empathy and a deeper under-
standing of the emotional states being conveyed. This iterative, hands-on process aligns with
Sch¨on’s concept of reflective practice [16], where designers learn through direct interaction and
continuous refinement. By prioritizing emotional engagement and user-centered design, this
prototyping method ensures that haptic feedback systems not only function technically but also
create meaningful emotional connections.
Rapid prototyping is key to designing haptic systems that deliver precise emotional engage-
ment. Pane¨els et al. (2010) developed HITPROTO, a tool specifically designed for the rapid
prototyping of haptic user interfaces. Such tools allow designers to make real-time adjustments
to feedback mechanisms, ensuring that iterative testing is possible during the early design stages
and making haptic design more accessible to novice interaction designers. This ability to test

and refine haptic systems based on user feedback lowers barriers for novice interaction design-
ers and enhances the development of AHFS [42]. HITPROTO also exemplifies the need for
real-time iteration and emotional mapping capabilities within affective haptic design.
2.8
Ethical Considerations in Affective Haptics
As Affective Haptics become more advanced, increasingly integrated into everyday technology,
and compatible with artificial intelligence algorithms, the field raises critical ethical concerns,
including emotional manipulation, informed consent, cultural sensitivity, and data privacy. The
design and deployment of these systems require robust frameworks to ensure that emotional and
personal boundaries are respected. The following papers reviewed here provide a comprehen-
sive foundation for ethical practices within affective haptic design, aligned with the objectives
of this research.
2.8.1
Autonomy, Consent, and User Control
Eid and Al Osman (2016) emphasize the necessity of user autonomy, asserting that haptic sys-
tems must empower users to control their emotional experiences. Providing users with the
option to modify or opt-out of emotional stimuli is essential to avoid unwanted emotional influ-
ence, particularly in sensitive environments like mental health interventions and social commu-
nication [18]. Schoeller (2023) further highlights the potential risk of emotional manipulation in
immersive environments, noting that haptic feedback may unconsciously alter users’ emotional
states. This unintentional influence risks crossing ethical boundaries, necessitating thoughtful
system design to maintain users’ agency and psychological safety [46].
Ju et al. (2021) introduce the concept of haptic empathy, exploring the ethical responsibilities
involved in conveying emotional meaning through haptic interfaces. They stress that designers
must remain vigilant in ensuring that haptic stimuli do not overwhelm or manipulate users,
recommending iterative testing and close observation to maintain users’ emotional well-being
during interaction [28]. Similarly, Akshita et al. (2015) warn of the risks associated with
multi-modal systems. While the combination of visual and haptic stimuli can enhance user
experiences, it also carries the potential for overstimulation or unintended emotional arousal.
Their study underscores the importance of transparency and obtaining informed consent when
deploying such feedback systems [2].
2.8.2
Data Privacy and Emotional Surveillance
The ethical management of emotional data emerges as a significant concern in the literature.
Vyas et al. (2023) explore the implications of using data-driven algorithms in real-time to pre-
dict and influence users’ emotional states. They argue that while personalized haptic interven-
tions can enhance emotional engagement, they also introduce the risk of emotional surveillance
and potential misuse of emotional data [57]. Eid and Al Osman (2016) further stress that cultural
differences in touch perception necessitate careful contextualization to avoid misinterpretation


============================================================

23
or intrusion. They call for stronger ethical frameworks to guide data collection, storage, and
usage, ensuring that users retain control over how their emotional responses are monitored and
shared [18].
2.8.3
Emotional Dependency and Psychological Impact
The emotional impact of haptic feedback requires cautious consideration, particularly in vul-
nerable populations. Macdonald et al. (2021) explore the role of calming haptics in addressing
social anxiety, highlighting the benefits of these technologies in social environments. However,
they also caution against the risk of emotional dependence, where users might over-rely on these
stimuli to regulate their emotional states. This dependency underscores the need for designers
to carefully evaluate the psychological consequences of their interventions and to incorporate
safety mechanisms that promote emotional resilience [33].
Eid and Al Osman (2016) and Ju et al. (2021) advocate for collaborative development with clin-
ical professionals, especially in mental health contexts, to ensure that haptic designs are aligned
with therapeutic goals and do not inadvertently harm users. Integrating experts from psychol-
ogy and mental health fields can provide essential oversight, helping to safeguard participants’
emotional well-being throughout the design process [18, 28].
2.8.4
Cultural Sensitivity and Contextual Awareness
Designers must also consider the cultural contexts in which haptic systems are deployed. Tset-
serukou et al. (2009) highlight the importance of cultural sensitivity when designing emotion-
ally resonant haptic feedback. Their research on virtual social interactions reveals that different
cultures may interpret touch-based feedback in varying ways, posing challenges for universal
design. They recommend adaptive systems that align with cultural norms to prevent miscom-
munication or discomfort [55].
Similarly, Ju et al. (2021) emphasize that emotional meanings conveyed through haptic inter-
faces must be calibrated according to users’ cultural expectations. They warn that failure to do
so can result in unintended emotional responses, reducing the effectiveness of the system and
potentially causing harm. This highlights the need for cross-cultural research and user-centered
design processes that involve participants from diverse backgrounds [28].
2.8.5
Addressing Ethical Challenges Through Design
Given the profound psychological impact of Affective Haptics, this study was conducted with
careful attention to ethical considerations. Participants were fully informed about the nature of
the study and provided with opportunities to withdraw or modify their involvement at any stage.
During emotionally sensitive discussions, care was taken to ensure that participants were not
pressured to share or engage beyond their comfort levels, and appropriate support was made

available as needed. These practices align with the principles set forth by the American Psy-
chological Association (2017), which emphasize transparency, respect for autonomy, and par-
ticipant well-being in research contexts 5.
In alignment with recommendations from Vyas et al. (2023) and Eid and Al Osman (2016),
the study also incorporated strategies to mitigate emotional manipulation risks. This included
limiting the emotional intensity of haptic stimuli and ensuring participants had control over
their interactions. Moreover, participants’ data was handled with strict confidentiality, adhering
to data privacy standards and ensuring that emotional responses were not shared beyond the
research context without consent.
2.8.6
Remark
The integration of Affective Haptics into everyday technology presents unique ethical chal-
lenges that must be navigated with care. This study has drawn from established ethical frame-
works and best practices to ensure participant well-being, transparency, and respect for personal
and cultural differences. Future research should continue to refine these practices, incorporat-
ing multidisciplinary perspectives and developing adaptive, user-centered systems that prioritize
autonomy, emotional safety, and cultural sensitivity. By adhering to these principles, affective
haptic technologies can be harnessed to enhance emotional well-being without compromising
ethical integrity.
2.9
Summary
The field of HCI has undergone significant evolution, from its early focus on usability and ef-
ficiency in the first wave, to its current emphasis on emotional, experiential, and social dimen-
sions in the third wave. Affective Haptics, which uses tactile feedback to evoke or communicate
emotions, aligns with this third wave by focusing on enhancing emotional engagement through
personalized and immersive UXs. As technologies such as wearable devices and virtual reality
interfaces grow in prevalence, the potential for affective haptic feedback to foster or regulate
user emotions has become a key area of research.
Despite its potential, Affective Haptics, specifically single-modal haptic feedback, remains
technically complex and inaccessible to set up for novice interaction designers and researchers.
Current haptic toolkits often require advanced technical skills, which limits the ability of new
designers to experiment with and integrate affective haptic feedback into their work. To ad-
dress this gap, this thesis proposes a modular toolkit that simplifies the design of single-modal
affective haptic feedback, drawing from established frameworks and methodologies such as
body maps (soma design), embodied metaphors (psychology, and cognitive neuroscience), the
Circumplex Model of Affect (behavioral, cognitive neuroscience), and Experience Prototyping
(interaction design).

Methodology
This section describes the methodology for designing, implementing, and evaluating a mod-
ular methodological toolkit aimed at helping novice interaction designers create single-modal
emotionally affective haptic feedback designs based on a personal, emotionally attached object
they brought to the workshop. The study combines theoretical frameworks, such as an Emotion
Typology [20] and the Circumplex Model of Affect [43] with practical prototyping tools and
frameworks like Experience Prototyping, body maps, and embodied metaphor elicitation [5,
11, 15, 56] to facilitate the learning and prototyping process of novice interaction designers for
affective haptic feedback.
3.1
Participant Selection and Recruitment
The careful structuring of the participant selection for this study ensured that the modular
toolkit’s intended audience — novice interaction designers with little prior experience in de-
signing AHFS — could test it. The study aimed to assess how well the toolkit facilitated the
learning process for individuals unfamiliar with haptics, while also ensuring diversity in back-
ground and experience level to capture a broad range of perspectives.
3.1.1
Recruitment Process
Participants were students with a background in HCI and a background in coding front-end
interfaces, targeting students enrolled in courses related to interaction design, UX design and
research, and front-end development. The primary criteria for participant selection were as
follows:
1. Novice in Haptic Design: Participants were required to have little to no prior experience in
designing haptic feedback systems. This ensured that study participants for the toolkit workshop
would be novice interaction designers and researchers who represent its primary target audience
— designers with a basic understanding of interaction design but without a background in haptic
design or coding haptic feedback.
2. Interest in Affective Haptics: Participants were selected based on their expressed interest in
learning about Affective Haptics, as indicated in the recruitment phase of this thesis workshop.
This was done to ensure participants had intrinsic motivation and were eager to engage with the
emotional aspects of haptic feedback and share honest feedback about the methodology toolkit
angle and effectiveness to teach them single-modal Affective Haptic Design.
3. Diverse Backgrounds: To capture a wide range of insights, participants from various disci-
plines within HCI and design were selected, including those with backgrounds in:
• digital concept development,
• UX design,


============================================================
PAGE 39
============================================================

3
METHODOLOGY
26
• industrial product design,
• psychology & cognitive sciences, and
• multimedia technology development.
This diversity helped assess the toolkit’s usability across different fields within the design, soft-
ware & hardware development, and cognitive science communities.
4. International and Language Diversity: Given the global nature of design communities,
participants included only non-native English speakers to evaluate how well the toolkit commu-
nicated complex emotional and technical concepts to a linguistically diverse group.
3.1.2
Participant Demographics
A total of six participants were recruited for the study, divided into three pairs. Each pair
worked together throughout the workshop sessions to foster collaboration and mutual learning.
The small group size allowed for in-depth interaction with the toolkit during the workshop
and ensured that participants received sufficient guidance and time for feedback during the
workshop.
Gender Balance: Efforts were made to include both male and female participants to explore
any potential gender differences in emotional perception and response to haptic feedback. All
pairs were paired up differently to have all possible combinations(i.e. 1: (W, M) 2: (M, M) 3:
(W, W)).
Age Range: Participants ranged in age from 22 to 30 years, reflecting the typical demographic
of postgraduate design students and early-career professionals.
Cultural and Educational Backgrounds: Participants came from varied cultural backgrounds,
ensuring a diverse set of perspectives on the emotional interpretation of haptic stimuli. This
diversity also helped assess the toolkit’s applicability across different cultural contexts. As
shown in subsection 4.1, the participants had varied backgrounds, which enriched the workshop
discussions and outcomes. Each phase of the workshop, detailed in Sections 3.2.4 to 3.2.7, was
carefully designed to build upon the previous one, guiding participants through the process of
designing affective haptic feedback using the toolkit’s modular methodological processes.
3.1.3
Participant Pairing
All six participants were divided into 3 pairs to reflect the Tandem Design approach used in
the study. The pairing was done strategically to mix different skill levels, ensuring that each
pair had complementary strengths in either the theoretical or practical aspects of design and
identified challenges that could be better weighted, based on the interpretation of the feedback
and correlation to the participants’ professional background. For example, BP1 had significant
experience with prototyping tangible interactive products, making that participant a suitable

27
candidate for pairing with BP2, who had less experience but contributed with conceptual under-
standing from a psychological academic background. This setup consideration along all three
groups promoted peer learning.
Collaborative Learning: By working in pairs, participants engaged in continuous feedback
loops, which are crucial for iterative prototyping. One participant would act as the designer,
creating and adjusting the haptic feedback, while the other acted as the test subject, providing
immediate feedback on the emotional impact of the design. This collaborative structure mim-
icked real-world design environments where teamwork is essential. These instructions were not
set as rigid role assignments but rather as a guideline to ensure participants had a starting point
and worked collaboratively on their AHSD.
3.1.4
Selection Rationale
The selection criteria aimed to create a participant group representative of novice interaction
designers who might use the toolkit in real-world scenarios to develop haptic designs. The
choice of recruiting students as described in the diverse background paragraph3.1.1, but were
still unfamiliar with the specifics of affective haptic technology and its design. This balance
was important for the exploratory nature of the research and for addressing the gap between
conceptualizing single-modal affective haptic feedback design and technical haptic on-body
prototyping.
With the selected participants fulfilling the criteria described previously, the workshop was able
to assess not only the usability of the toolkit but also its capacity to support a wide range of
users in different design contexts. This diversity in selection also ensured that any challenges
related to learning curves, certain cultural interpretations of emotional feedback, and collabo-
rative design dynamics could be identified and addressed in the final evaluation of the toolkit’s
proposition.
Participants were asked to bring an object of their choice that they have an emotional connection
to and are willing to share details about in a group setting. They were informed that during the
workshop conduction, they would be working in a Tandem Setup, in which participants were
paired up and supposed to communicate their preferences to another fellow designer or elicit
the emotional triggers for another participant’s object.
3.1.5
Informed Consent and Ethical Considerations
The study was conducted in adherence to strict ethical guidelines to ensure the protection of
participant rights, privacy, and well-being throughout the research process. This subsection de-
tails the procedures followed to secure informed consent, maintain confidentiality, and address
ethical concerns related to the emotional nature of Affective Haptic Design.
Informed Consent Procedure
Before the beginning of the study, all participants were re-
quired to provide informed consent (see Appendix 57). This process was designed to ensure


============================================================
PAGE 41

3
METHODOLOGY
28
that participants fully understood the nature of the study, the role they would play, and any
potential risks or benefits associated with their participation. The consent form was sent to the
participants 2 weeks before the workshop date and was filled out and received before starting
the workshop.
Information Briefing
: Each participant received a comprehensive information sheet that
outlined the study’s objectives, the workshop structure, the specific tasks they would engage in,
and the types of data that would be collected. This document also provided a brief overview of
haptic technology and the relevant methodologies mentioned in the introduction of this method-
ology section3, and the significance of their involvement in the study.
Consent Forms
: After reviewing the information sheet, participants were asked to sign the
informed consent form, indicating their voluntary participation. The consent form covered key
aspects such as:
• The purpose of the study of testing a combination of methodologies to teach single-modal
Affective Haptic Design and the participant’s role.
• The right to withdraw from the study at any time without any penalty or explanation.
• Assurance of anonymity and confidentiality regarding any personal data collected.
• Consent to the collection of qualitative data (e.g., demographic survey, voice recorded
discussion rounds, body maps, embodied metaphor sheets, haptic design patterns) and
quantitative data (e.g., experience levels, haptic feedback patterns).
• The use of photographs or screenshots of the workshop setup, procedure, and Miro board
content provided that no identifiable personal information was included in such materials.
Voluntary Participation
: The informed consent process emphasized that participation was
entirely voluntary, and participants were informed that they could withdraw at any time, with
no negative consequences for their academic standing or professional reputation.
3.2
Research Design
This study utilizes a Tandem Design methodology, where participants work in pairs to design
haptic feedback systems. This approach mimics real-world collaborative design processes often
found in professional environments and emphasizes user-centered design based on the Experi-
ence Prototyping approach of Buchenau and Suri in 2000 [11]. Each pair consists of two novice
interaction designers who work together to iterate on their on-body haptic prototypes, providing
feedback and making adjustments in real-time.
The workshop followed a multi-phase structure, designed to build participants’ skills in Af-
fective Haptic Design incrementally. Each phase introduced core concepts of haptic feedback


============================================================

29
and emotion-based design, progressing from theoretical discussions to hands-on on-body hap-
tic prototyping. Participants initially explored embodied metaphors, using body maps to ex-
press emotional associations with their objects. This phase was followed by iterative on-body
prototyping, where participants used the Hapticlabs DevKit to design feedback patterns. The
structured flow ensured a balance between emotional reflection and technical skills, which was
intended to foster a gradual learning curve. However, qualitative feedback highlighted some
issues with transitioning between phases, particularly related to the technical limitations of the
hardware, such as connectivity problems and limited actuator types, which impacted the creative
exploration of emotional design patterns (BP2, CP1).
Each tandem group was instructed to engage with an ’emotional object’ that they brought to the
workshop. These objects were introduced during an initial presentation round where partici-
pants described the emotions associated with their objects and used a body map to note areas of
emotional resonance (see the result section 4). This phase allowed participants to reflect on how
emotions were felt physically, mapping their object-related emotions to specific body parts. For
example, Participant AP2 linked their object (a ring) to a feeling of support and admiration,
mapping these emotions onto the chest and neck area. These body maps were then used as a
basis for placing haptic actuators during the on-body prototyping sessions. Additionally, par-
ticipants were guided through embodied metaphor elicitation, where metaphors linked to their
objects (e.g., ’soft but supportive’) were translated into vibration patterns.”
Workshop Room Setup
The workshop provided participants with a range of resources to
facilitate both the theoretical understanding and practical application of haptic design. These
materials were thoughtfully curated to guide participants through each phase of the workshop,
enabling them to engage with the emotional, metaphorical, and physical aspects of haptic feed-
back design.

both their personal devices and the shared projection. The setup fostered discussions and group
activities.

Figure 1 shows the room setup used during the workshop. The U-shaped arrangement of ta-
bles was designed to promote interaction between participants during discussions and group
activities. This arrangement allowed each participant to have personal space for their creative
prototyping, while still enabling easy collaboration and observation of others’ work. A projec-
tor was used to display the Miro board (updated template can be found in Appendix B, which
participants could interact with on their personal devices or refer to on the screen during group
presentations and activities. This dual engagement—through the shared projection and individ-
ual laptops—facilitated both independent exploration and group cohesion.
In the middle of the U-formation was a table containing additional materials such as the Hap-
ticlabs DevKit, writing utensils, and post-it notes for brainstorming exercises (see Figure 4 for
more details on the kit). This arrangement ensured that the necessary tools for both digital and
physical prototyping were readily accessible, supporting the iterative and collaborative nature
of the workshop.

The workshop provided various materials to support both digital and physical prototyping dur-
ing the sessions. The digital materials and results of the workshop can be found in the Medi-
acube Github in appendix B. As shown in Figure 2, a central table was placed in the middle
of the U-shaped table configuration to offer participants quick access to essential materials.
This included colorful pencils for body map creation, sticky notes for brainstorming, power
plugs, and power banks for charging the Hapticlabs DevKit satellites, and crepe tape, which
participants used for on-body prototyping due to the low adhesive strength that made it safe and
comfortable to use on skin. Additionally, a voice recorder was operated by the researcher to
capture qualitative feedback during the discussion rounds, enabling the participants to engage
in conversational and unobtrusive feedback sessions.
Figure 3 shows a second table placed to the side, offering more physical materials for prototyp-
ing. These materials included scissors, cardboard for structure building, slimmer tape, strings,
cloth fabric, elastic mesh sleeves for arm-based prototyping, and plastic styrofoam tubes. These
items allowed participants to explore more creative and tangible approaches in their haptic de-
sign processes, giving them the flexibility to create more complex, embodied prototypes.
Hapticlabs DevKit
The Hapticlabs DevKit6 was the primary technical tool provided to partic-
ipants (see Figure 4. It included three different types of actuators — ERM (Eccentric Rotating
Mass) actuators, which produce vibrations through an off-center mass rotation; LRA (Linear
Resonant Actuator) actuators, which generate vibrations via linear oscillations; and Piezoelec-
tric actuators, which create precise vibrations using piezoelectric materials — each capable of
producing varied haptic feedback. This allowed participants to explore a wide spectrum of
tactile sensations, adjusting factors such as:
• Intensity: Participants could modify the strength of vibrations or force feedback.

• Frequency: They could alter how fast or slow the vibrations occurred, simulating differ-
ent emotional intensities.
• Patterns: Using the software, participants could choose pre-programmed vibration pat-
terns or create their own, allowing for highly personalized affective feedback experiences.
The kit was connected to laptops via USB-C or Bluetooth and controlled through the Hapticlabs
Studio software7. Participants were provided with access to the Pro License of the software
before the workshop, ensuring they were familiar with its interface during hands-on prototyping.
The goal of the kit was to encourage rapid, iterative prototyping, enabling participants to ex-
periment with one or two actuators to design haptic feedback designs that aligned with their
emotional and metaphorical design concepts. The simplicity of the kit made it accessible, while
its flexibility allowed for a range of creative outputs.
Figure 4: The Hapticlabs DevKit used during the workshop, containing actuators (ERM, LRA,
VC), a satellite controller, touch triggers, and adapter cables. This kit was distributed to three
tandem groups (A, B, and C) to prototype on-body haptic feedback systems. Participants used
these components to design AHFS without the need for coding.
The Hapticlabs DevKit (Figure 4) served as the primary hardware resource during the work-
shop. Each tandem group received one kit, which included essential components for prototyp-
ing single-modal haptic feedback. This no-coding hardware kit allowed participants to focus
on the emotional and design aspects of haptics without the barrier of technical programming
knowledge. The toolkit contained:
• Actuators: Eccentric Rotating Mass (ERM), Linear Resonant Actuator (LRA), and Voice
Coil (VC), which provided a range of tactile sensations.
• Satellite Controller: The main controller used to connect the actuators and configure
haptic feedback patterns through the Hapticlabs Studio software.

• Touch Trigger: Sensors that could activate haptic feedback based on touch, adding an
interactive dimension to participants’ designs.
• Adapter Cables: Used to connect actuators and other sensors to the satellite controller.
This kit enabled participants to explore different tactile sensations and translate emotional con-
cepts into physical haptic feedback. Despite some technical challenges, such as connectivity
issues, the DevKit played a crucial role in the iterative prototyping sessions described in the
methodology section of this thesis.
Embodied Metaphor Elicitation Template
One of the central resources for translating ab-
stract emotions into concrete haptic feedback was the embodied metaphor elicitation template,
which is based on the concept presented by Bakker et al. [5] and was newly created for this
workshop that can be examined in Figure 5. This worksheet guided participants through an in-
depth exploration of the personal object they brought to the workshop, asking them to reflect on
the emotional significance and sensory characteristics of the object. The template was divided
into sections that helped participants articulate their thoughts systematically:
• Object Identification: Participants noted the object’s name, the emotion it represented,
and why it was personally meaningful.
• Physical Characteristics: This section focused on sensory details such as texture, weight,
temperature, and any other qualities that could serve as metaphors for emotions.
• Personal Connection Context: Participants detailed associated memories or experiences
that gave emotional weight to the object.
• Metaphorical Translation: This section prompted participants to brainstorm how the
object’s physical attributes could be transformed into haptic feedback, considering the
context in which such feedback could be used and how it might evoke similar emotions
in others.
The worksheet also included space for discussions with their tandem partner, allowing for feed-
back and the refinement of ideas. This process helped participants bridge the gap between
emotional experience and technical prototyping, ensuring a thoughtful approach to design.
Body Map Templates
The body map templates were essential for documenting how partic-
ipants physically experienced emotions in their bodies. Participants were provided with both
male and female body maps, enabling them to mark areas where they felt specific emotions
related to the object they brought to the workshop. This exercise gave participants a visual
reference for identifying emotional hotspots on the body, which later informed their decisions
about where to place haptic feedback actuators during prototyping.

printed out and served as visual tools for marking emotional zones, actuator placements, and
prototype testing areas during the on-body prototyping sessions. Participants used these maps
to express the locations where specific sensations or emotions were felt and experimented with
haptic feedback placements accordingly.

Key components of the Body Mapping exercise included:
• Front and Back Views: The body maps included both front and back perspectives, en-
couraging participants to think about how emotions might be felt asymmetrically or in
multiple areas.
• Annotation of Sensations: Participants were instructed to mark the maps with colors,
symbols, or descriptions to convey sensations like warmth, tightness, tingling, or relax-
ation.
• Reflection on Emotional Intensity: They were asked to rate the intensity of emotions in
different areas on a scale from 1 to 10, which helped guide the strength of haptic feedback
during the prototyping phase.

Body maps were introduced as a key tool to facilitate the translation of emotional experiences
into physical sensations, offering participants a tangible framework to explore the relationship
between affect and embodiment.
Body maps served as a foundational tool for participants to visually represent the connection
between emotions and physical sensations.
Guiding Questions for Body Maps
To support the body mapping exercise, participants were
given a set of Guiding Questions for Body Maps (see Figure 8). These questions encour-
aged deeper reflection on how emotions were felt physically and how these sensations could be
translated into haptic feedback. The guiding questions were structured around key areas such
as:
• Identify Emotional Zones: Where in your body do you feel the strongest emotional
responses? Can you pinpoint specific areas where you feel emotions like happiness, sad-
ness, anger, or calmness?
• Intensity and Sensation: How intense are these emotions? Describe the sensation asso-
ciated with each emotion (e.g., warmth, tightness, tingling).
• Context and Triggers: What situations or triggers usually lead to these emotional re-
sponses? How does your body physically react in these situations?

• Metaphorical Connections: How does the object you brought represent the emotion you
feel? Can you draw a connection between the sensation of the object and the sensation in
your body?
• Temporal Dynamics: Do these emotions and sensations change over time? Are there
specific times or events that intensify them?
• Feedback Placement: Based on your identified emotional zones, where would you place
haptic feedback to enhance or modulate these emotions? What type of haptic feedback
(e.g., vibration, warmth) would evoke these emotions in the marked areas?

Guiding Questions
For The Body Maps
Figure 8: Guiding questions provided during the workshop to inspire participants during the
emotional mapping and prototyping processes.
The body maps and guiding questions were instrumental in helping participants navigate the
design process. They facilitated the translation of subjective emotional experiences into tangible
haptic feedback, promoting empathy and alignment between design intent and user experience.
This iterative process allowed participants to align their prototypes with emotional concepts
such as comfort, safety, and playfulness, ensuring a user-centric design approach.
These questions helped participants think more critically about the emotional and physical as-
pects of their design, ensuring that the haptic feedback was thoughtfully aligned with the emo-
tional intent.

Designers can effectively map complex emotions into the Circumplex Model of Affect [43, 45]
by using body mapping and embodied metaphors to link emotional experiences with physical
sensations. They can then turn the derived valance and arousal into tactile sensations that can
have emotional meaning for the user. To test H11.4, I implemented embodied metaphors and
body maps in the design process and evaluated their impact on communication effectiveness
among novice interaction designers.
Miro Online Platform
The Miro Online Platform was used as a collaborative workspace
where participants were presented with informative slides as explained in the next sections and
documented their design processes. Using this platform allowed participants to:
• Upload Body Maps and Templates: Participants could photograph their completed body
maps and upload them to Miro and fill out metaphor elicitation sheets for easy reference
during the prototyping phase with their tandem partner.
• Create Visual Notes: The platform’s virtual sticky notes and drawing tools enabled par-
ticipants to jot down ideas, sketch feedback mechanisms, and annotate their designs.
• Track Feedback and Iterations: Miro allowed participants to share their work with
their Tandem Design partners, facilitating real-time feedback and iterative design im-
provements.
• Organize Prototypes: Participants used Miro to document and share photos of their
prototypes, making the process of refining and testing designs more interactive and col-
laborative.
Miro served as a vital tool for content presentation, organizing ideas, tracking progress, and
ensuring collaboration between Tandem Design partners and all workshop participants.
Emotion Typology and Circumplex Model of Affect
Two theoretical frameworks — the
Emotion Typology and the Circumplex Model of Affect — were provided to help participants
understand the emotional spectrum and map emotions onto haptic feedback patterns.
• Emotion Typology: Developed by the Delft Institute of Positive Design, this tool cate-
gorized emotions into pleasant and unpleasant states, providing participants with a wide
range of emotional descriptors. This typology was essential for helping participants ar-
ticulate emotions and identify target emotional states for their haptic designs.
• Circumplex Model of Affect: This model plotted emotions along two dimensions: va-
lence (pleasantness) and arousal (activation). By using this model, participants could
classify their emotional experiences and map them to specific haptic feedback designs.
For example, high-arousal positive emotions might correspond to rapid, intense vibra-
tions, while low-arousal negative emotions might call for subtle, slow feedback.

The combination of these materials and resources created a comprehensive environment in
which participants could explore, document, and design AHFS. By integrating theoretical frame-
works, practical tools, and collaborative platforms, the workshop aimed to equip novice interac-
tion designers with both the knowledge and hands-on experience needed to engage with Affec-
tive Haptic Design and gain valuable insights into answering the research questions. The use of
templates, guiding questions, and body maps fostered a deeper understanding of how emotions
manifest in the body. At the same time, the Hapticlabs DevKit enabled participants to translate
these insights into experimental, tangible haptic experiences.
3.2.2
Tandem Design Approach
The Tandem Design approach is a key component of the workshop methodology, facilitating
both collaborative learning and iterative prototyping. In this approach, participants work in
pairs, alternating between the roles of designer and user. This method builds on principles from
participatory design and Experience Prototyping [11, 50], allowing participants to actively en-
gage in both the creative process of designing and the experiential process of receiving and
evaluating haptic feedback. By switching roles, participants gain a comprehensive understand-
ing of both perspectives, which is essential for designing affective haptic feedback.
Roleplaying in Experience Prototyping
Roleplaying is an integral part of the Tandem De-
sign approach. In each pair, one participant takes on the role of the designer, responsible
for creating and adjusting the haptic feedback, while the other participant acts as the user,
experiencing the haptic feedback and providing real-time feedback based on their emotional re-
sponses. This approach encourages participants to think beyond their own experiences, engag-
ing in role reversal to better understand how haptic feedback can be designed to elicit specific
emotional responses in others.
Experience Prototyping, as outlined by Buchenau and Suri [11], emphasizes the importance
of firsthand experience in the design process. By roleplaying both as a designer and user,
participants can explore how haptic feedback interacts with emotional states, bodily sensations,
and contextual factors. This not only helps participants refine their prototypes but also fosters
empathy, as they are required to consider their partner’s emotional and physical experiences.
The Tandem Design approach mimics real-world collaborative environments but is particularly
suited for emotional haptic design due to its emphasis on continuous peer feedback and iterative
refinement, as supported by studies in Affective Haptics and participatory design mentioned in
the introduction and related work section of this thesis12.
Designer Role The designer uses the Hapticlabs DevKit (see Section 4) to create on-body
haptic feedback patterns, drawing from the embodied metaphor elicitation and body map tem-
plates to guide their design decisions. They are encouraged to consider the user’s feedback
in real-time, making iterative adjustments to the intensity, frequency, and patterns of the hap-
tic feedback. The designer is also responsible for documenting the prototyping process, using
platforms like Miro to track changes and refine ideas.

User Role The user’s role is equally critical in the Tandem Design approach. As they expe-
rience the haptic feedback, they provide detailed feedback on how the sensations align with
the emotional and physical experiences mapped during earlier phases. Users are encouraged
to reflect on the quality and emotional resonance of the feedback, making annotations on their
body maps to document areas where the feedback feels most relevant or effective. This ongoing
dialogue between user and designer forms a continuous feedback loop, essential for refining the
prototype.
Peer Learning and Feedback Working in pairs also facilitates peer learning, as participants
are not only engaged in the design process but are also learning from one another’s insights and
feedback. This aligns with principles from participatory design, where collaboration and shared
ownership of the design process are emphasized [50]. As participants alternate between roles,
they must articulate their design rationale and provide constructive feedback to their partner.
This back-and-forth dialogue ensures that both participants contribute to and learn from the
design process, fostering a deeper understanding of creating AHFS.
Mutual Feedback Loops: The Tandem approach allows for continuous feedback loops, where
the designer receives real-time input from the user and adjusts the design accordingly. This
process is iterative and dynamic, reflecting the principles of participatory and Experience Pro-
totyping [16]. The immediate feedback helps to refine the haptic feedback designs in ways that
are responsive to the emotional and physical needs of the user, ensuring that the final design is
both effective and meaningful.
Problem-Solving and Collaboration: The collaborative nature of the Tandem Design ap-
proach encourages problem-solving, as participants must work together to address design chal-
lenges. For instance, if the user finds the haptic feedback too intense or unaligned with their
emotional state, the designer must quickly adapt and explore new patterns or placements. This
iterative problem-solving process reflects real-world design team dynamics, where collabora-
tion and communication are critical to achieving successful outcomes. By working together,
participants learn to balance technical feasibility with emotional impact, a key skill in Affective
Haptic Design.
Role Reversal and Reflective Practice
A crucial aspect of the Tandem Design approach is the role reversal that occurs midway through
the workshop. After the first round of prototyping, participants switch roles, allowing the de-
signer to become the user and vice versa. This shift is essential for fostering a holistic under-
standing of the design process, as participants experience both the creation and reception of
haptic feedback. Role reversal also encourages reflective practice, as participants must reflect
on their own experiences as users to inform their design decisions when they switch to the
designer role.
Reflective practice is a key concept in design thinking, where designers are encouraged to reflect
on their experiences and use those reflections to improve their designs [16]. By experiencing
their own designs from the user’s perspective, participants gain valuable insights into how their
design choices affect the emotional and physical experiences of the user. This reflection helps
to refine and improve the design, ensuring that the final haptic feedback system is not only
technically sound but also emotionally affective.

Real-time Reflection:
After each round of roleplaying, participants engage in brief reflec-
tion sessions, discussing their experiences as both designer and user. These discussions help
participants identify key design decisions and reflect on their rapid on-body prototyping, fos-
tering a deeper understanding of how to create effective haptic feedback systems. Participants
are encouraged to document their reflections in Miro, creating a record of their iterative design
process and the lessons learned from each round of prototyping.
Enhancing Iterative Prototyping
The Tandem Design approach also enhances the iterative
nature of prototyping, as participants continuously refine their designs based on feedback from
their design partner. This iterative process is critical for Affective Haptic Design, where small
adjustments to haptic feedback can have a significant impact on the emotional resonance of
the system. By alternating between roles and continuously gathering feedback, participants
can refine their prototypes in real-time, ensuring that the final design is both emotionally and
physically engaging.
Rapid Prototyping Cycles:
The workshop is structured around rapid prototyping cycles,
where participants are encouraged to make quick, iterative design adjustments. This approach is
informed by Experience Prototyping practices, where the focus is on creating a tangible experi-
ence that can be rapidly tested and refined through the direct feedback of the on-body prototype
experience [11]. By iterating quickly, participants can test multiple versions of their haptic
feedback systems directly on the user, gathering insights from each iteration and using them to
improve the final design.
Simulating Real-World Design Environments
Finally, the Tandem Design approach simu-
lates real-world design environments, where designers often work in teams and must balance
multiple perspectives and feedback sources. In a professional setting, designers must not only
consider their own vision but also take into account the needs and preferences of users, clients,
and collaborators. By working in pairs, participants in the workshop experience this dynamic
firsthand, learning to balance their own creative ideas with the feedback and insights provided
by their partners.
The collaborative, feedback-driven nature of the Tandem Design approach helps to prepare par-
ticipants for real-world design challenges, where communication, empathy, and iteration are
essential for success. By the end of the workshop, participants have gained both the techni-
cal skills and the collaborative mindset needed to design emotionally AHFS in a professional
context.
The Tandem Design approach is a powerful method for fostering peer learning, collaboration,
and iterative design in the context of Affective Haptics. By alternating between the roles of
designer and user, participants gain a comprehensive understanding of both the technical and
emotional aspects of haptic feedback design. This approach not only enhances the prototyping
process but also encourages empathy, reflective practice, and collaborative problem-solving, all
of which are essential skills for creating effective and meaningful haptic systems.

3.2.3
Ethical Considerations
Throughout the research design and execution, ethical considerations were rigorously addressed
to ensure participant well-being, data privacy, and integrity of the study. First and foremost,
informed consent was obtained from all participants, with a thorough explanation of the study’s
objectives, procedures, and any potential risks. Participants were briefed on the voluntary nature
of their involvement, with the assurance that they could withdraw from the study at any time
without any consequence. The consent forms clearly outlined how personal data, including any
emotional or physiological feedback gathered during the workshops, would be anonymized to
protect the privacy of participants (see Appendix 57.
Given the sensitive nature of some of the emotional and physiological data involved in haptic
feedback design, particular attention was paid to data handling. Emotional experiences, body
mapping annotations, and feedback related to the emotional resonance of haptic prototypes were
treated with utmost confidentiality. The data was anonymized, with any identifying information
being removed before analysis. Additionally, the research followed strict data storage protocols,
ensuring that all information was securely stored and only accessible to authorized researchers
involved in the project.
The study also emphasized emotional sensitivity throughout the workshop. Participants were
encouraged to engage with positive emotional experiences, particularly in the metaphor elicita-
tion and body mapping phases, to avoid inducing discomfort or distress. To further safeguard
participants, the body mapping exercise — which involved identifying areas of the body where
emotions were felt — was conducted with careful consideration of privacy and participant com-
fort. No sensitive areas were explored, and participants were instructed to disclose only what
they were comfortable sharing.
In addition to protecting participant data, the study’s ethical framework also emphasized the
reciprocal nature of feedback in the Tandem Design methodology. The role reversal between
designer and user not only encouraged empathy but also ensured that participants experienced
the emotional and physical implications of their prototypes designed for another personalized
UX. This helped mitigate the risk of unintended emotional or sensory discomfort in the final
prototypes. Participants were constantly reminded that they had the right to pause or modify
the activities if they felt uncomfortable at any stage.
The study’s framework was further aligned with broader ethical principles within HCI and Af-
fective Haptics, including respect for user agency, attention to emotional impact, and the im-
portance of inclusivity in design. Ethical considerations thus shaped the study’s design from
inception to data analysis, ensuring a respectful, safe, and emotionally aware research environ-
ment.
The four steps of the toolkit testing workshop are designed to ensure a cumulative learning
experience and enough participant feedback to make informed decisions for the next iteration
of the methodological toolkit for Affective Haptic Design. Each phase builds on the one before
it.

3.2.4
Phase 1: Introduction to Emotional Frameworks, Haptic Theory, and Initial Sur-
vey - 30 Minutes
Participants are introduced to the foundational concepts for this Affective Haptics workshop.
This includes a presentation of the Emotion Typology, the Circumplex Model of Affect, which
categorizes emotions based on their valence (positive-negative) and arousal (high-low), and an
introduction to the basic terminologies of haptics, setting the focus on tactile feedback design.
Participants are given an overview of the technical aspects of haptics, including how haptic
actuators work, what tactile feedback entails, and the different types of sensations that can be
generated through haptic devices. This model serves as a key theoretical tool for guiding partic-
ipants in mapping emotional states to haptic feedback patterns. This phase provides participants
with the necessary background to think critically about the emotional and technical components
of haptic design.
Emotion Typology:
Participants are introduced to the Emotion Typology, developed by the
Delft Institute of Positive Design. This tool categorizes a wide range of emotions and serves as a
conceptual framework to help participants understand the various emotional responses [20] that
haptic feedback could be designed for and have a reference that also supports non-native English
speakers to articulate their emotions precisely. The Emotion Typology by the Delft University
of Technology is an open-access online database that contains thorough information on both
positive and negative emotions, which suits this toolkit approach. It contains descriptions about
60 emotions, 24 of which are pleasant and 36 negative.
For each emotion, the database contains the following information:
• Formal definition of the emotion
• Explanation of causes and responses
• Three clips from popular movies expressing that emotion
• Typical verbal expressions
• Cartoon mini-story (currently available for negative emotions only)
• Comparisons with similar emotions (currently available for negative emotions only)
• References to scientific sources for further reading on emotions
In this thesis, the framework is used as a foundation for recognizing, identifying, and defin-
ing emotions during the design process. At the beginning of the workshop, participants were
asked to place a colored dot on the emotion they felt right now to start the engagement and
spark their interest in exploring the Emotion Typology. For the sake of straightforwardness, the
color codes for emotions from the Emotion Typology were not used and were chosen by the
participants based on personal preference. Also, participants were asked to pick positive emo-
tions for this workshop to avoid unpleasant experiences during the object metaphor elicitation,
body mapping, or prototyping sessions which aligns with the initiative of the Emotion Typology
authors Delft Institute of Positive Design.

to understanding emotional nuances in their designs. The Emotion Typology, developed by the
Delft Institute of Positive Design, served as a key tool in the workshop. More information about
the Emotion Typology can be found at https://emotiontypology.com/.
Circumplex Model of Affect:
Building on the Emotion Typology, participants are introduced
to the Circumplex Model of Affect [43], which plots emotions along two dimensions: valence
(positive-negative) and arousal (high-low). This model provides a systematic way to map emo-
tions to haptic feedback as described in section 2.3.
Figure 10: Workshop participants placing their emotions on the Circumplex Model of Affect
[43, 45]. In this activity, participants reflected on their emotional states and categorized them
based on valence (positive-negative, horizontal) and arousal (high-low, vertical). This exercise
helped participants gain a deeper understanding of the emotional spectrum and how it could be
translated into haptic feedback.
Introduction into Haptic Feedback:
In the workshop’s initial phase, participants were intro-
duced to the foundational concepts of haptic feedback. Haptic feedback, as outlined in this ses-
sion, refers to the use of touch sensations to communicate information to users through forces,
vibrations, or motions applied by a device. This can enhance interactions by providing tactile
signals, particularly in environments where visual or auditory feedback may be insufficient or
overloaded. Participants were introduced to key terminology, including the distinction between
single-modal experiences, where one sense is stimulated, and multi-modal experiences, where


============================================================

multiple senses such as sight, hearing, and touch are combined.
The session further differentiated between two primary forms of perception relevant to haptic
feedback: kinaesthetic perception, which relates to muscle and joint feedback (such as “I feel
how full my glass is”), and tactile perception, which involves the skin’s receptor feedback re-
garding texture, material, vibration, and temperature. These perceptions play crucial roles in
the design and reception of haptic systems, particularly in emotionally affective feedback.
Participants also got an introduction into the various types of haptic feedback, such as passive
haptics, where physical object attributes like texture and weight are considered, and active hap-
tics, which involve electric components like vibration motors and vibrotactile actuators. For
the workshop, the focus was primarily on active tactile feedback systems, as these technologies
allow for finer control and are central to many Affective Haptic Design projects.
Throughout this warm-up lecture, participants were made aware that haptic feedback is in-
herently personal, culturally specific, and context-dependent. This haptic introduction made
participants familiar with the basics of tactile perception and how to evaluate and refine haptic
feedback systems in a design context. This introductory phase drew heavily on resources from
Hapticlabs’ tutorial on haptic feedback, ensuring that participants had a solid technical founda-
tion before moving on to hands-on prototyping activities with the Hapticlabs DevKit which will
be discussed in more detail in the material section. More information on this tutorial is available
through the Hapticlabs website9.
Mapping Everyday Haptics to the Circumplex Model of Affect:
To reinforce the theoreti-
cal frameworks, participants engage in an exercise where they are asked to recall and categorize
everyday haptic experiences (e.g., the vibration of a mobile phone, the feel of a door closing,
or a heartbeat simulation). They are, again, instructed to place these examples on the Circum-
plex Model of Affect, considering how the sensation corresponds to different combinations of
valence and arousal. This exercise helps participants to get familiar with the emotion simplifi-
cation process, actively engage with the emotional dimensions of haptic feedback and apply the
frameworks to real-world examples.
The Circumplex Model of Affect was used to create an overview of haptic technology and hap-
tic feedback they already know from everyday life. This phase aimed at giving a terminology
overview of emotions in the English language, learning to simplify emotional stimuli onto the
Circumplex Model of Affect. To introduce haptic technologies, explaining how actuators work,
the types of tactile sensations (e.g., vibrations, pressure) that can be generated, and how these
sensations are mapped to emotional experiences guided them into the first exercise of sorting
haptic technologies they already are familiar with into the Circumplex Model of Affect, mani-
festing the concept of deriving an emotion into an interpretation of valance and arousal.
Following this theoretical introduction, participants are guided through key emotional frame-
works that will serve as the basis for their haptic design process:

of valence and arousal. This process familiarized participants with simplifying emotional stim-
uli into a two-dimensional representation, helping them connect emotional responses to haptic
feedback in real-world contexts. The exercise also provided an introduction to various haptic
technologies, explaining how tactile sensations (e.g., vibrations, pressure) are produced and
how they relate to emotional experiences.

Demographic and Haptic Experience Survey:
After the first exercise, participants complete
the first haptic survey. The survey collects demographic information, their prior experience with
haptic design, and their familiarity with the methodologies introduced. This survey helps to
establish a baseline for participants’ knowledge and comfort levels with the concepts that will
be used throughout the workshop. This helped get an overview of the prior knowledge and was
considered when evaluating the qualitative feedback from each participant, drawing correlations
to their prior experience and demographic information. The questions for this survey can be
looked up in the appendix 6.6.
• Demographics: Information such as age, education, previous education, current job ti-
tle, field of profession, and pursuit career is collected. Here the participants also stated
what emotionally connected object they have brought for the workshop, what emotion is
attached to it, and an associated adjective for the object or emotion.
• Prior Experience: Participants note any prior experience with haptic design, embodied
metaphors and body map methodologies.
• Familiarity with Methodologies: Participants self-assess their familiarity with relevant
concepts on a Likert-scale from 1(not familiar) to 5(very familiar). The following skills
were questioned: Haptic Prototyping, On-body prototyping, Coding, Haptic Design, Af-
fective Haptic Design.
This introductory phase sets the foundation for the workshop, ensuring that participants are
familiar with both the technical and emotional aspects of haptics, and providing a clear baseline
for their starting knowledge and experience.

Phase 2: Embodied Metaphor Elicitation and Body Mapping - 50 Minutes
The second phase of the workshop is designed to deepen participants’ engagement with both
the emotional and physical aspects of haptic feedback design by using embodied metaphor elic-
itation and body mapping techniques. This phase involves multiple steps to guide participants
through the process of translating abstract emotional experiences into tangible haptic feedback
systems. Through structured activities, participants explore the emotional resonance of objects
they brought with them and begin to associate specific bodily sensations with these emotions.
Each tandem group was instructed to engage with an emotional object that they brought to the
workshop. These objects were introduced during an initial presentation round where partici-
pants described the emotions associated with their objects and used a body map to note areas
of emotional resonance. This phase allowed participants to reflect on how emotions were felt
physically, mapping their object-related emotions to specific body parts. For example, Partic-
ipant AP2 linked their object (a ring) to a feeling of support and admiration, mapping these
emotions onto the chest and neck area. These body maps were then used as a basis for plac-
ing haptic actuators during the on-body prototyping sessions. Additionally, participants were
guided through embodied metaphor elicitation, where metaphors linked to their objects (e.g.,
”soft but supportive”) were translated into vibration patterns.

jective. The survey also includes questions about participants’ familiarity with concepts like
haptic prototyping, on-body prototyping, coding, and Affective Haptic Design. This baseline

Embodied Metaphor Elicitation and Emotional Object Sharing
This initial activity cen-
ters around the participants’ objects that they were asked to bring for the workshop. The objects
are meant to evoke specific emotions, which participants will use to inform their haptic design
process. The sharing of these objects and the emotions attached to them acts as an icebreaker
and a bridge into a more focused reflection on emotional design.
• Object Introduction Round: Participants are introduced to the concept of embodied
metaphors. They are then asked to present their objects, explaining the personal emotional
connection they have to them. Each participant shares why the object is significant, what
emotions it evokes, and how the physical properties of the object relate to those emotions.
This round is recorded and later transcribed to ensure that participants can refer back to
their insights during the design process. This exercise also helps participants articulate
emotional experiences, creating a shared understanding within the group and preparing
them for deeper emotional exploration. The introduction serves to reinforce the role of
metaphor in translating abstract emotions into tangible design elements [5, 39].
• Exploring Emotional Metaphors: After introducing their objects, participants are asked
to reflect on and document the sensory qualities of their object, considering its emotional
impact and the metaphors that can be drawn from its physical characteristics. For exam-
ple, if a participant brought a soft blanket associated with comfort, they may describe the
blanket’s warmth and softness as metaphors for the feeling of emotional security. These
reflections are shared with their Tandem Design partners to foster understanding and em-
pathy in preparation for the prototyping phase. The discussions help participants develop
early ideas about how to translate these emotional experiences into haptic sensations.
The purpose of this activity is to provide participants with a framework for thinking about
how everyday objects can be imbued with emotional meaning. The process of discussing and
documenting these emotions lays the groundwork for the more technical and physical elements
of the workshop. For further details, please refer to section 4.
Body Mapping for Emotional Baseline (5 Minutes)
Building on the insights from the metaphor
elicitation exercise, participants are introduced to body mapping, a technique often used in
soma-based design, to document how emotions are experienced physically. Participants use
body maps to represent where they feel specific emotions in their bodies visually. This step
aims to create an emotional baseline for each participant, guiding haptic feedback design later
in the workshop.
• Introduction to Body Mapping: Participants are shown a series of slides that explain
how body maps are used to document the location and intensity of emotions felt within
the body. The introduction highlights differences in sensitivity across different body parts,
drawing attention to how certain areas like the hands, feet, and face are more sensitive
to tactile feedback than the back or limbs. This understanding helps participants make
informed decisions later about where to place haptic feedback actuators on the body.

• Activity Instructions: Participants are given templates of male and female body maps,
and instructed to mark areas of the body where they feel specific emotions associated
with the object they discussed. They are encouraged to annotate the body map with
colors, symbols, and descriptions that help convey the intensity and type of sensation
(e.g., warmth, tightness, relaxation). They are also encouraged to document both the
front and back of the body, noting any asymmetries in how the emotion is experienced
across these areas.
• Guiding Questions for Body Mapping: To support the body mapping process, partici-
pants are provided with a set of guiding questions. These questions prompt participants
to reflect on the intensity and quality of the emotion, asking them to rate sensations on a
scale from 1 to 10, describe how the emotion manifests physically, and consider whether
certain contexts or triggers intensify the sensations. Participants are also asked to think
about how they might translate these sensations into haptic feedback. These questions en-
courage participants to internalize their emotional responses and connect these responses
with tangible design concepts.
Documentation of Ideas for the Prototyping Session (20 Minutes)
After introducing the
body mapping exercise, participants started internalizing and creating body maps to document
their emotional and sensory reflections in preparation for the upcoming prototyping session.
They were instructed to also fill out the embodied metaphor elicitation template provided on
their dedicated workspace. This documentation process helps them solidify their thoughts and
prepare for collaboration with their Tandem Design partners.
• Use of Embodied Metaphor Elicitation Workspace: Participants use a pre-designed
workspace to document their object and associated emotions. This workspace includes
the Circumplex Model of Affect and the Emotion Typology to help participants simplify
the emotional experience into valence and arousal dimensions. They are also encouraged
to take photographs of their object and include descriptive notes that will serve as a refer-
ence point during the prototyping process. The worksheet asks participants to reflect on
the emotional experience of interacting with their object and begin to ideate on potential
haptic feedback mechanisms that could evoke similar emotions.
3.2.6
Phase 3: Prototyping Sessions - 2x 45 Minutes
The third phase of the workshop centered on the practical implementation of the theoretical and
conceptual knowledge participants had gathered in the first two phases. During this phase, the
Hapticlabs DevKit and previously created body maps and embodied metaphors were used to
foster Lo-Fi, on-body affective haptic prototype design processes.
Participants were encouraged to engage in an iterative design process, where they would alter-
nate between creating, testing, and refining their haptic feedback prototypes. They worked in
pairs, with one participant taking on the role of the designer, and the other assuming the role of

the user. This setup provided opportunities for both participants to contribute to the design pro-
cess while experiencing the affective haptic feedback as intended for their partner’s emotional
object.
Hapticlabs DevKit Setup and Exploration (10 Minutes)
The workshop started with partic-
ipants setting up and exploring the Hapticlabs DevKit. This toolkit includes three actuators —
ERM (Eccentric Rotating Mass), LRA (Linear Resonant Actuator), and Piezoelectric actuators
— which are capable of generating various haptic feedback patterns.
ERM Actuators are simple, cost-effective components with limited control over feedback in-
tensity but capable of creating strong vibrations.
LRA Actuators are more precise, offering responsive and complex vibrations, often used for
more intricate haptic designs.
Piezoelectric Actuators offer the highest precision and fastest response but are more complex
and expensive, allowing for high-fidelity prototyping.
Participants were asked to download and install the Hapticlabs software on their laptops prior
to the workshop. Each group was provided with unique activation codes to enable them to use
the software for prototyping purposes. Once the software was set up, participants connected the
Hapticlabs satellite kit via USB and started exploring the functionality of the actuators through
the software interface.
The setup allowed participants to adjust the following:
Intensity: Control over the strength of the feedback.
Frequency: Manipulation of how fast or slow the vibrations are produced.
Patterns: Participants could explore pre-programmed or customized vibration sequences, or
create their own from scratch using the Hapticlabs Studio software with the Hapticlabs DevKit
connected.
They were encouraged to experiment and familiarize themselves with the Hapticlabs DevKit
and Hapticlabs Studio software, preparing them for the more detailed prototyping work to fol-
low. This exploration phase helped them choose the appropriate actuator for their affective
haptic feedback design.
Pairing Up and Prototyping Cheatsheet (5 Minutes)
Once participants were familiar with
the Hapticlabs DevKit, they were paired up with their tandem partner from earlier phases. Be-
fore diving into prototyping, they received a “Prototyping Cheatsheet” as a guideline, which
reiterated key concepts to keep in mind during the prototyping sessions:
User-Centered Design: Focus on the emotional experience of the user, continuously gathering
and incorporating feedback into the design.
Experience Prototyping: Roleplaying the interaction context to think about nuances and UXs.
Participants were advised to keep their prototypes simple and focus on the conceptual ideas.

Hands-On Prototyping: Engage in designing and testing Lo-Fi, on-body haptic prototypes
based on the body maps and embodied metaphor elicitation sheets.
Iterative Prototyping: Rapid prototyping followed by iterative testing. Feedback was to be
documented through notes, photos, and short voice or video recordings.
The cheatsheet also reminded participants to utilize:
Body maps to identify where on the body emotions are felt, and where haptic feedback might
be applied.
Embodied metaphor elicitation to guide the design of feedback patterns, considering how tex-
tures and sensations could be translated into haptic form.
This overview provided participants with structure and confidence as they began prototyping.
Prototyping Process (2 Rounds of 45 Minutes each)
The prototyping session was structured
into two rounds to ensure that both participants in each tandem team (A,B& C) had the oppor-
tunity to design and experience two affective haptic feedback designs. Participants engaged
in two 45-minute prototyping sessions, during which they used the methodological toolkit and
Hapticlabs DevKit to design and iterate on haptic feedback patterns based on their body maps
and metaphor elicitation exercises. The workshop provided a limited set of actuators, which
participants were encouraged to explore while iterating on their designs. Each round lasted 45
minutes, and roles were switched after the first round to give both participants the chance to
take the perspective of both the designer and the user.
Prototyping Round One
Role Assignment:
Participant 1 took on the role of the User(U) and was testing and evaluating the haptic prototype.
Participant 2 took on the role of the Designer(D), developed the haptic feedback patterns, and
discussed where actuator placement would be suitable.
User Role (Participant 1): The U tested the haptic prototype on the body, shared their embod-
ied metaphor elicitation sheet with the D to start the ideation process, and provided real-time
feedback. This feedback involved talking through their experiences, filling out body maps, and
reflecting on how well the haptic feedback aligned with the affective impact of their emotional
object.
Designer Role (Participant 2): The D developed AHFD using the Hapticlabs software and
Hapticlabs DevKit. They attached actuators to specific locations on the U’s body (as identified
in the body map) and asked open-ended questions to gather more detailed feedback from the U.
Documentation and Iteration: Both participants were encouraged to document their process
through Miro, taking photos, making voice recordings, and filling out notes and body maps.
The D would iterate on the feedback patterns based on the U’s reactions, continuously refining
the prototype.

Prototyping Round Two
In this round, the participants switched roles to ensure that both
experienced being both the D and the U.
Role Switch:
Participant 1 became the Designer(D).
Participant 2 became the User(U).
The prototyping process continued as described in the first round, with the D creating haptic
feedback designs based on the embodied metaphor and body map of the U. This switch allowed
both participants to engage fully in the creative and experiential aspects of prototyping.
Feedback Loop and Documentation: Throughout both rounds, participants continued iterat-
ing on their designs and documented their process using the tools provided. They uploaded
photos, notes, and screenshots of their work into the Miro workspace.
Documentation and Reflection (10 Minutes)
After completing both prototyping rounds,
participants were reminded to upload their design documentation, including their notes, photos,
videos, and completed body maps, into the shared workspace. They were also asked to engage
in a brief recorded discussion with their tandem partner to reflect on their experiences during
the prototyping sessions.
Participants discussed the challenges they encountered, the insights they gained from their part-
ner’s feedback, and any potential improvements for their designs. This reflection session aimed
to solidify their learning and prepare them for the next steps in refining their prototypes.
Create: Design and prototype Lo-Fi, on-body AHFS.
Document: Capture the design process, challenges, and outcomes using the provided templates
and personal documentation.
Discuss & Reflect: Gather insights, iterate on the prototype, and prepare for further refinement
of the affective haptic feedback design.
This methodology phase ensured that participants were able to fully engage with the practical
elements of affective on-body haptic prototyping. By utilizing the Hapticlabs DevKit, applying
their conceptual understanding of emotions and haptics, and working collaboratively with their
partner in a Tandem Setup, they gained hands-on experience in creating AHFS.
3.2.7
Phase 4: Surveys and Group Reflection - 25 Minutes
In the last part of the workshop, participants were asked to give detailed feedback on how they
felt about the Tandem on-body prototyping process, how useful the methodological toolkit was,
and how well the Emotion Typology, the Circumplex Model of Affect, the embodied metaphor,
and body mapping techniques helped them turn the emotions of their chosen object into haptic
feedback. This phase involved two key activities: a final individually written quantitative survey
and a final group discussion with six guiding questions. Both of these aimed to collect qual-
itative and quantitative data to inform the evaluation of the workshop and the methodological
techniques directly linking back to the research questions and hypotheses of this thesis1.4.

Individual Survey:
The individual survey included open-ended questions to capture partici-
pants’ personal reflections on various aspects of the workshop, including the methodologies in-
troduced and their experience with haptic feedback design. The survey questions were designed
to provide insights into how the participants understood and applied the toolkit, as well as the
emotional frameworks (such as the Circumplex Model of Affect and embodied metaphors) that
underpinned the design process. The survey included the following sections:
• General Usefulness: This section asked participants to reflect on the overall usefulness
of the workshop in helping them understand and apply haptic feedback in their designs.
It explored which parts of the workshop were most beneficial and which were potentially
challenging. This section directly relates to evaluating the toolkit’s usefulness in fostering
a comprehensive understanding of haptic design for novice interaction designers.
• Body Maps and Embodied Metaphors: These questions explored how participants used
body maps and embodied metaphor elicitation in their design process. For example,
participants were asked how useful they found the body maps in guiding their haptic
design and whether they would use this methodology again. This data helps to assess
the hypothesis that body mapping and embodied metaphor elicitation can be useful for
novice interaction designers to translate emotional experiences into tactile feedback.
• Prototyping and Toolkit Usage: Participants were asked about the challenges they faced
during the prototyping phase and how well the haptic feedback aligned with the emotions
they intended to evoke. They were also asked to provide recommendations for improving
the toolkit and suggest additional materials that could enhance the workshop experience.
This section aimed to gather insights into the technical aspects of the toolkit, its acces-
sibility, and its ease of use for novice interaction designers, aligning with the research
question about the toolkit’s usefulness.
Group Discussion:
Following the individual survey, a group discussion was held to promote
reflective thinking and to allow participants to share their experiences, insights, and challenges
openly. The discussion was semi-structured, with guiding questions presented to steer the con-
versation toward specific aspects of the workshop. The group discussion was designed to en-
courage participants to think critically about the usefulness of the toolkit, the process of embod-
ied metaphor elicitation, and their collaborative prototyping experience.
The discussion was framed around two core themes:
• Insights and Challenges: Participants were asked how the prototyping sessions helped
them understand the emotional impact of their designs and whether the embodied metaphor
exercises aided their emotional translation into haptic feedback. This section provided
valuable information on how well participants engaged with the emotional dimensions
of the design process, testing the hypothesis that embodied metaphor elicitation fosters a
better understanding of emotional states in haptic design.

• Future Improvements: This section allowed participants to reflect on the toolkit’s po-
tential for improvement, as well as the overall workshop structure. Questions explored
what features or tools would make the workshop more user-friendly for beginners, aiming
to gather feedback on the ease of learning and prototyping with the toolkit. This feedback
was essential for refining the toolkit for future use and validating the effectiveness of the
methodology for novice interaction designers.
By collecting both individual and group feedback, this phase aimed to assess the participants’
overall satisfaction with the workshop, their ability to design emotionally affective haptic feed-
back, and how well the embodied metaphor and body mapping techniques supported their cre-
ative process. The data collected directly informs the research question regarding how well the
workshop facilitates emotional haptic design and provides insights into how the toolkit can be
optimized for future workshops.

Data Collection and Analysis
Qualitative Data:
• Observation Notes: During the workshop, participants’ interactions with the toolkit and
their partner were documented and clarified through brief check-in discussions. This in-
cluded noting significant breakthroughs, challenges, and the dynamics between the Tan-
dem Design partners during the prototyping iterations.
• Surveys and Group Discussions: During the workshop, surveys and discussions pro-
vided insights into participants’ experiences with the toolkit and their emotional design
processes.
• Design Artifacts: Body maps, metaphor descriptions, and design sketches were collected
and analyzed to uncover patterns in emotional engagement, haptic design choices, and the
participant’s expertise.
Quantitative Data:
• Familiarity with Methodologies: In Phase 1’s demographic survey, participants’ famil-
iarity with certain skills was determined using 5-point Likert scales to indicate their
knowledge prior to the workshop and their correlated qualitative feedback.
• Feedback Forms: Participants rated various aspects of the toolkit, including its clarity,
ease of use, and usefulness of the affective haptic feedback created and the workshop
material used to teach the concepts of affective haptic design.

Data Analysis:
• Thematic Analysis: Qualitative data were analyzed for recurring themes related to emo-
tional resonance, usability, and creative exploration. Themes were cross-referenced
with design outcomes to evaluate the toolkit’s overall usefulness.
• Relationship of Skill level and Toolkit Feedback: Quantitative data from the demo-
graphic survey about their skill level3.2.4 were taken into consideration when evaluating
their qualitative feedback. This was done to put their input into context for the reader and
draw conclusions for intersections of feedback throughout different professional back-
grounds.
3.2.9
Summary
The workshop was meticulously structured to guide participants through the intricate process
of affective haptic design, blending theoretical frameworks with hands-on, on-body prototyping
activities to facilitate comprehensive learning. The session commenced with an introduction to
Emotion Typology, a project developed by TU Delft, which categorizes emotions into posi-
tive and negative dimensions. Participants were instructed to lean towards positive emotions;
however, the initial exercise invited them to express how they were feeling on the day of the
workshop. This exercise was supported by an interactive website featuring detailed information
cards for each emotion, including relatable scenarios, example movie clips, visual represen-
tations, and typical expressions. This resource proved particularly beneficial for non-native
English speakers, as it provided accessible descriptions and context, aiding in the accurate ar-
ticulation of complex emotions.
Subsequently, the workshop delved into the Circumplex Model of Affect, which maps emotions
along two axes: valence (unpleasant to pleasant) and arousal (activation to deactivation). Partic-
ipants were guided to distill their complex emotions into this model, simplifying their emotional
landscape into manageable categories. This reduction facilitated a clearer understanding of how
specific emotions could be translated into haptic feedback patterns. Following this, an activity
focused on real-life applications of haptics encouraged participants to brainstorm various sce-
narios where tactile feedback could enhance UXs. This exercise broadened their perception of
haptic design possibilities and underscored the versatility of haptic feedback in different con-
texts.
A pivotal component of the workshop was the embodied metaphor elicitation exercise. Partici-
pants were prompted to associate their emotionally significant objects with bodily experiences,
translating abstract emotions into tangible design elements. For example, a participant who
associated a basketball toy with feelings of calmness designed a haptic pattern mimicking the
rhythmic motion of dribbling. This methodology emphasized the importance of metaphors
grounded in physical experiences, enabling participants to create more nuanced and emotion-
ally affective haptic feedback.
The body maps activity further reinforced this translation process. Participants were provided
with pre-printed body map templates and instructed to denote areas of their bodies that corre-

sponded with the emotions linked to their chosen objects. Guidelines included the use of colors
and symbols to represent different emotions and areas of emotional sensitivity. Additionally,
references to skin sensitivity across various body parts informed participants about the appropri-
ate placement of haptic actuators. Guiding questions facilitated reflection on emotional zones,
intensity, and temporal dynamics, enabling participants to make informed decisions about where
and how to apply haptic feedback to evoke desired emotional responses.
The workshop culminated in Tandem Design prototyping sessions, where participants were di-
vided into pairs and alternated between the roles of designer and user. Equipped with Haptic
Labs hardware kits and access to specialized software, participants engaged in low-fidelity on-
body prototyping, iteratively designing and refining haptic feedback patterns based on real-time
user feedback. This hands-on approach emphasized user-centered design principles, encourag-
ing collaborative problem-solving and immediate iteration to enhance the emotional impact of
their designs.

This section presents the comprehensive findings from the workshop, detailing the participants’
demographic background, their engagement with the proposed methodological toolkit in the key
activities, and the overall impact of the different phases of the workshop. It includes a detailed
exploration of participants’ feedback, emotional articulation, and technical experiences with
haptic design. These findings directly address the research questions in section 1.4 and provide
the groundwork for the subsequent discussion of the effectiveness, challenges, and areas for
improvement in the single-modal affective haptic workshop.

Participant Demographics and Initial Survey Results
In the following findings from the initial surveys in phase 1 (3.2.4), the outcomes of the work-
shop, and the qualitative feedback provided by the participants is presented.
The initial survey at the end of phase 1 3.2.4 aimed to collect comprehensive demographic
data, assess participants’ prior experience with haptic design and related methodologies, and
understand their expectations and qualitative feedback for the workshop structure. This baseline
information was crucial for meaningfully interpreting the qualitative feedback. Knowing the
participants’ backgrounds made it possible to propose changes to the workshop structure and
toolkit usage to the broad range of novice interaction designers and researchers’ needs.
Taking the participants backgrounds into consideration gives a detailed correlation between
their prior knowledge and feedback on the toolkit’s perceived usefulness in teaching the nu-
ances of affective haptic feedback design. This complex interdisciplinary field should be made
accessible to novice interaction designers coming from a range of research fields described in
paragraph 2.6.

Emotional Objects and Initial Expectations
Emotional Object For the Embodied Metaphor Elicitation
As part of the workshop, par-
ticipants brought emotionally significant objects, which anchored their emotional exploration
throughout the design process. For instance, AP1 brought a ring associated with admiration and
love, while CP2 brought a stuffed lion evoking calmness, comfort, and protection. These objects
provided a personal and emotional starting point for participants to engage with affective haptic
design, creating an immediate link between their emotional experiences and the workshop’s
goals.

Derived Expectations for the Workshop
While the initial survey did not explicitly ask for
the participants expectations towards the workshop, insights can be inferred from participants’
backgrounds and self-assessments that further inform the context of their qualitative feedback
given.
Participants’ expectations generally revolved around gaining foundational knowledge of Affec-
tive Haptics, exploring new design methodologies, and overcoming potential technical chal-
lenges (particularly for those with limited coding experience). The participants’ varied skill
levels required for affective haptic design and expectations towards the learning process high-
lighted the need for adaptable, accessible tools throughout the workshop.
• Learning Objectives:
– Participants like AP2 and CP2, with minimal experience in haptic design, likely
aimed to gain foundational knowledge.
– Participants with some experience (e.g., BP1) might have sought to deepen their
understanding, particularly in affective haptic design.
• Anticipated Challenges:
– Those with lower coding skills (e.g., BP2) might have been concerned about tech-
nical aspects.
– Participants unfamiliar with embodied metaphors and body maps might have antic-
ipated challenges in applying these methodologies.
• Collaboration Interests: The diversity in skills suggested opportunities for peer learn-
ing, with participants potentially eager to collaborate and share their diverse expertise.
• The objects varied widely but were universally associated with positive emotions(aligning
with the intent described in the related work section 2 by the TU Delft Emotion Typology
9) and personal significance.
• These objects served as focal points for the workshop’s activities, grounding abstract
emotional concepts in tangible experiences.

sign.
– Overall low familiarity with affective haptic design and related methodologies like
Circumplex Model of Affect, embodied metaphors and body maps.
• Diverse Skill Sets:
– A range of coding proficiencies, emphasizing the need for accessible tools.
– Participants’ backgrounds spanned design, engineering, psychology, and UX, offer-
ing a rich collaborative potential.
• Emphasis on Emotional Connection: Personal objects and associated emotions pro-
vided a meaningful starting point for the workshop, aligning with the focus on teaching
single-modal affective haptic design.
4.1.5
Interpretation of Initial Survey Findings: Pros and Cons of the Participant Con-
stellation
The initial survey revealed a diverse yet specialized group of six participants, each bringing
unique backgrounds and varying levels of experience to the workshop. Pros of this constella-
tion include a strong foundational knowledge in HCI and related disciplines, as evidenced by all
participants holding or pursuing master’s degrees in fields such as HCI, Multimedia Technology,
Industrial Product Design, Psychology, UX Design, and Digital Concept Development. As the
RQ1 1.4 This academic diversity fosters a rich interdisciplinary environment, encouraging the
exchange of varied perspectives and fostering innovative approaches to affective haptic design.
Additionally, the presence of participants with moderate experience in haptic prototyping and
design (e.g., AP1, BP1, CP1) provides a balanced mix of novices and those with some practical
exposure, facilitating peer learning and mentorship within Tandem Design groups. The varied
professional roles, ranging from Industrial Designers and Interaction Designers to Senior Appli-
cation Developers and UX/UI Designers, further enhance the collaborative potential, allowing
participants to leverage their specific expertise to support each other’s learning processes.
However, there are notable cons associated with this participant constellation. The small sam-
ple size of six limits the generalizability of the findings, as it may not capture the full spectrum
of novice interaction designers’ experiences and challenges. Moreover, the group exhibits sig-
nificant variability in familiarity with key skills pertinent to the workshop, such as embodied
metaphors, body maps, and affective haptic design, with most participants rating their familiar-
ity as low to moderate. This disparity necessitates a highly adaptable workshop structure to cater
to both relatively experienced individuals and complete beginners, potentially diluting the focus

for those with existing knowledge. Additionally, the limited prior experience in affective haptic
design and on-body prototyping among the majority highlights a steep learning curve, which
could lead to uneven engagement and varying levels of success in applying the methodologies
introduced. Technical proficiency also varied, particularly in coding skills, where only one
participant (AP2) reported high proficiency, while others rated themselves significantly lower.
This uneven distribution of technical skills underscores the importance of providing compre-
hensive, beginner-friendly tools and extensive support to ensure all participants can effectively
engage with the prototyping toolkit. Furthermore, the homogeneity in educational backgrounds,
predominantly rooted in HCI and design, may inadvertently narrow the range of emotional in-
terpretations and design approaches, potentially overlooking insights from other relevant fields
such as cognitive psychology or cultural studies. Lastly, the emotional objects brought by par-
ticipants, while personally significant, were uniformly positive, which may limit the exploration
of a broader emotional spectrum in haptic design applications.
In summary, the participant constellation presents a balanced mix of academic and profes-
sional backgrounds that enrich the collaborative environment and foster interdisciplinary learn-
ing. However, the small and somewhat homogeneous sample size, coupled with significant
variability in prior experience and technical skills, introduces challenges in ensuring equitable
engagement and comprehensive skill development. Addressing these cons through tailored in-
structional support, diversified participant recruitment, and enhanced toolkit features will be
essential in future iterations to maximize the effectiveness and inclusivity of the workshop.

Key Activities
In order to understand the feedback given by the participants, the workshop activities and their
contributed work have to be mentioned and explained. In the following paragraphs the emo-
tional connection and usage of methodologies of each participant is explained in detail.
Remarks
The iterative nature of the prototyping sessions was designed to allow for smooth
transitions between phases, encouraging participants to refine their designs based on real-time
feedback. However, in practice, these transitions were not always as fluid as anticipated. Tech-
nical issues, such as limited haptic actuators and challenges in understanding the functionality of
the hardware, frequently interrupted the flow of the workshop. For instance, BP2 and AP1 both
expressed frustration with the limitations of the provided tools, noting that the lack of diversity
in haptic actuators constrained their creative output. Moreover, participants struggled with the
practical application of the haptic toolkit, particularly in translating abstract emotional concepts
into effective haptic feedback. While some, like BP1, found success in prototyping simple,
repetitive patterns, others, like CP2, faced obstacles in generating more complex emotional rep-
resentations. This disparity in outcomes indicates that the current iteration of the toolkit may
require further refinement, particularly in terms of offering more technical guidance and time or
pre-workshop preparation for the participants and expanding the range of haptic tools available.
These findings suggest that while the iterative design approach holds promise, it must be sup-
ported by more robust technical frameworks and clearer instructional support to ensure a more

Emotion Mapping
AP1 Emotional Mapping of the Ring
In addition to describing the emotional significance of the ring (Figure 13, AP1’s baseline body
map (Figure 25) illustrates key physical areas, such as the chest and hands, where AP1 expe-
riences warmth and grounding sensations. The embodied metaphor elicitation sheet (Figure
31) further expands on how these sensations could be translated into haptic feedback patterns,
particularly through calming vibrations and minor rotations mimicking serenity.
AP2 Emotional Mapping of the Keychain AP2’s body map (Figure 26) highlights the neck as
a key area where warmth can be felt, reflecting her emotional connection to the keychain (Figure
14). The metaphor elicitation sheet (Figure 32) further explores potential haptic feedback, such
as firm, familiar textures and comforting vibrations in the neck, which can evoke hope and
gratitude.
BP1 Emotional Mapping of the Necklace BP1 mapped his emotional connection to the neck-
lace (Figure 15), highlighting the chest and lower back areas (Figure 27) as key emotional zones.
The metaphor elicitation sheet (Figure 33) explores how pulsing vibrations in these areas could
evoke a sense of safety and confidence, reinforcing emotional grounding.
BP2 Emotional Mapping of the Basketball Flummi BP2’s body map (Figure 28) shows how
his emotional connection to the basketball toy (Figure 16) is centered on the hands and shoul-
ders, where they associate rhythmic motions with nostalgia. The metaphor elicitation sheet
(Figure 34) further details how rhythmic vibrations simulating dribbling could be translated
into comforting haptic feedback for stress relief.
CP1 Emotional Mapping of the Corn-Shaped Plushie CP1’s body map (Figure 29) illustrates
how comfort and nostalgia associated with the plushie (Figure 17) are felt primarily in the arms
and torso. The metaphor elicitation sheet (Figure 35) proposes that haptic feedback simulating
the sensation of being held or hugged could replicate these comforting emotions.
CP2 Emotional Mapping of the Stuffed Lion CP2’s body map (Figure 30) highlights the chest
and arms as key areas where the stuffed lion (Figure 18) evokes feelings of calm and protection.
The metaphor elicitation sheet (Figure 36) explores how rhythmic, wavy haptic feedback in the
arms and warmth in the chest could replicate the feeling of being hugged or held, alleviating
anxiety.

Baseline Body Mapping
Participants highlighted the value of body maps in visualizing where emotional experiences are
felt in the body, which guided the placement of haptic actuators. For instance, CP1 noted,
”I found the body map particularly useful in figuring out where I associate spe-
cific emotions. It gave me a clearer direction on where to start applying the haptic
feedback designs.”

Figure 14: AP2’s emotional object: A Mario extra life keychain gifted by an old roommate.
AP2 explained that the keychain serves as a metaphor for hope and safety, symbolizing the idea
of having an ”extra life” to hold onto in difficult times. AP2 compared it to a stress ball, but
more as a fidget toy instead of using it for particularly stressful situations.
. The correlated body map to this example and an explaination of the body map can be found in
Figure 29.
The body maps allowed participants to ground their emotional objects in physical sensations.
As seen in Figure X, BP1 mapped their emotional connection to a necklace around the neck and
upper chest area, which they later used as guidance during on-body prototyping. CP2 noted,
”This exercise helped me visualize where I feel certain emotions, especially when
interacting with the plush toy.”
The feedback gathered during the workshop highlighted varying experiences with the body
maps. Participant AP1 noted,
”I liked that [the body maps] gave me an initial idea of where I can place the actu-
ators. However, placing actuators on the chest created a weird, eerie feeling”.
Similarly, Participant BP1 appreciated the maps for visualizing how haptic feedback could be
designed across different parts of the body, remarking that

The necklace symbolizes hope and safety, serving as a reminder of the close friendships and
family relationships formed during that time, providing confidence and comfort. When BP1 is
stressed, this necklace alters his perspective and reminds him times are temporary and so are
his stressful times.
”using body maps enabled me to also see my options, and having the same pattern
on the chest and back creates different experiences.”
This feedback illustrates the value of body maps as a design tool but also reveals limitations,
such as difficulties in translating abstract emotional experiences into physical stimuli.
4.2.3
Embodied Metaphor Elicitation
The embodied metaphor elicitation section of the workshop was designed to help participants
translate abstract emotional experiences into tangible haptic feedback. Each participant shared
a personal object associated with a particular emotion and then mapped that emotion onto their
body through the process of embodied metaphor elicitation.
In general, participants provided detailed descriptions of their emotional connection to the
object, the physical characteristics of the object, and how these qualities might be translated
into haptic feedback. The discussions facilitated between participants and their partners were
recorded, and these provided further insights into how their initial design ideas evolved through
the elicitation exercise.

Figure 16: BP2’s emotional object: A small basketball Flummi toy, which evokes nostalgic
memories of his father and childhood. BP2 associated the object with a sense of safety and
comfort, recalling the warmth of familial experiences.
Participants leveraged their emotional connections to the objects to inform their haptic feed-
back designs, aiming to map their bodily sensations and emotional states directly onto the pro-
posed affective haptic feedback patterns. This process helped them understand how (embodied)
metaphor and emotion can be translated into affective haptic feedback.
However, some participants found that complex or abstract emotions posed challenges in trans-
lation. As AP2 reflected,
“I feel like this method can work well if you have a metaphor that can be trans-
lated easily into haptics, but I also feel like there is a limit to how well this can be
transferred. The more complex the initial embodied metaphor, the harder it is to
translate, I assume.”
This suggests that while embodied metaphors can be powerful tools, their effectiveness is con-
tingent upon their simplicity and the ease with which they can be mapped onto affective haptic
modalities.
The detailed insights provided in these metaphor elicitation sheets served as a strong foundation
for the next phase of prototyping.

Prototyping Documentations
AP1 Prototyping Body Maps
In this section, the first two iterations of prototyping conducted by AP1 are documented, which
used haptic actuators to explore emotional resonance with different body placements. Two
body maps were created to reflect changes in actuator placement and the participant’s sensory
feedback during the prototyping process.
The first iteration (Figure 37) focused on multiple placements, including the neck, chest, and
finger, but revealed discomfort in some areas. The most favorable placement was on the finger
where the haptic ring is usually worn. The actuator placement on the nose and ear was less
successful, as the feedback was either audible or created unpleasant sensations, particularly on
the stomach area.
The second iteration (Figure 38) refined the design, focusing on more successful placements
like the chest and wrist. This iteration adjusted the haptic feedback pattern to improve the
user’s sensory experience, noting that the new configuration on the wrist and chest provided a
pleasant sensation for AP1.
Additionally, Figure 39 shows the physical prototype of the haptic ring being tested during the

discomfort from tickling. The prototype was envisioned as having a mushroom shape to create
this sensation.
The second body map (Figure 42) shows the actuator placements after testing, which focused
on the wrist, forearm, and neck. AP2 noted that a cat-like purring sensation was pleasant on
the neck, as long as the intensity was kept low to avoid vibrating the skull. Multiple locations,
including the forearm, responded well to this pattern. The annotations reflect AP2’s feedback
on the tested haptic feedback patterns, specifically highlighting how the rising and falling in-
tensities produced calming sensations.
Figures 43 and 44 depict AP2’s hands-on prototyping process. In Figure 43, AP2 can be seen
placing the actuator on the forearm, one of the favorable areas from the second body map.
Figure 44 shows AP1 testing the actuator on the back of AP2’s neck, aligning with the initial
intention to create a secure sensation without tickling.

where CP2 feels a sense of calm and protection when interacting with the object. These areas
guided the placement of actuators during the on-body haptic prototyping.
BP1’s pre-prototyping body map illustrates how the participant envisioned the placement of
the actuators. The conceptual design was focused on creating feedback along the spine and
shoulders, with a secondary focus on the upper arms. The intensity of the feedback was likely
intended to reflect a sense of comfort and security, with specific areas marked for stronger versus
lighter sensations.
The second body map demonstrates how the group implemented their vision of ”confidence”
using two actuators. The CRA actuator was used on the lower back, and the Voice Coil actuator
on the mid-back. Together, these produced a pulsating sensation moving upwards, designed
to evoke a comforting, confidence-boosting feeling. The team paid particular attention to the
intensification of vibrations to ensure the sensation would be noticeable and consistent with
their intended emotional effect.
In the final image, one can see the prototyping in action. BP1 and BP2 are engaged in the tandem
on-body testing of the actuators, checking the sensation as it moves upwards along the spine.
The placement mirrors the areas highlighted in the pre-prototyping sketches and body maps,
ensuring consistency between the initial design and the physical sensation produced during
testing.
BP2 Prototyping Body Maps
BP2 began by translating emotional and physical sensations into a haptic feedback representa-
tion. As depicted in Figure 48, BP2 associated the hands with the sensation of a toy (a small
basketball-like object), which triggered activation input representing the rubbery, warm, and
squishy feel. Additionally, BP2 hypothesized a calming reoccurring pattern that could be ap-
plied to the temples for a sense of relaxation.
In the second body map (Figure 49), BP2 explored memories of childhood play with a focus
on ”flow” in a playful mindset. The body map highlights physical sensations of sweating and
running, particularly in the neck, chest, and armpit regions. The upper legs are marked as areas
of physical activation during play, transitioning into relaxation after the activity. The sensation
of holding the toy is emphasized, with distinct feelings of rubber, warmth, and squishiness
connected to the hands.

sketched a pattern that reflects the start of a dribble, transitioning into the powerful bounce and
rhythm of the basketball.
As shown in Figure 51, the prototype involved actuators taped onto a small basketball object
to simulate the dribbling sensation described in the body maps. BP2 used this tactile object to
explore how physical feedback relates to the sensation of dribbling a basketball.

CP1’s prototyping process aimed to recreate the sensation of petting a plushy toy through haptic
feedback. The participant focused on mimicking the stroking and petting of the soft object using
different actuators to simulate the feeling of the plush fabric’s texture. The goal was to provide
the sensation of petting without physically performing the hand or arm movement.
The first body map (Figure 52) shows the hands as the primary areas of interaction, marked
with annotations to mimic the motion of stroking the soft object. CP1’s first approach focused
on simulating the smooth texture of the plushy toy using an LRA actuator, designed to produce
a smooth and gradual petting sensation with a single peak. The metaphor for this pattern was

toy’s fabric using a Voice Coil actuator, with a pattern that includes multiple peaks, representing
the uneven texture.
The second image (Figure 53) shows CP2 testing the prototype by comparing the real sensation
of the plushy toy with the recreated haptic feedback pattern from the actuators, a crucial step in

hands, where the participant simulates the experience of playing with the plastic pearls inside
the toy’s belly. The feedback is characterized by mid-range intensity and frequency, replicating
an uncoordinated and arrhythmic sensation, much like the irregular movement of the pearls
inside the toy.
Figure 56: CP2 Prototyping Documentation: The participant created a pattern in Hapticlabs
Studio to replicate the feeling of plastic pearls running through her fingers when holding the
stuffed lion toy. The sensory interaction aimed to evoke a sense of calmness and reduce anxiety,
much like the real object. The haptic pattern uses mid-range intensities and irregular frequencies
to resemble the movement of pearls. The documentation also includes images of the stuffed lion
and explanations of the intended sensation.

Tandem On-body Prototyping
Building on the initial survey results, the workshop outcomes can be further detailed by analyz-
ing how the participants’ expectations and prior knowledge influenced their engagement with
the toolkit and their success in creating haptic prototypes.
Connection Between Prior Experience and Prototyping Success:
• Participants with more technical backgrounds (e.g., those with higher coding proficiency)
generally found it easier to grasp the technical aspects of the toolkit, such as actuator
programming and integration. However, they sometimes struggled more with the creative
aspects of translating emotions into haptic feedback.
• Participants with less technical experience but a stronger background in emotional design
or UX found the creative exercises, such as embodied metaphor elicitation, to be more
intuitive. They excelled in designing prototypes that were emotionally affective, even if
they required more support with the technical setup.
Role of Collaboration in Learning:
• The tandem approach facilitated peer learning, particularly for participants who were less
confident in certain areas. For example, participants with stronger coding skills were able
to assist their partners with the technical setup, while those with a better understanding of
emotional design helped translate these concepts into haptic feedback.
• Collaboration also helped participants overcome anticipated challenges by pooling their
knowledge and skills, which was crucial in creating useful, educative affective haptic
prototypes within the limited workshop timeframe.
Usefulness of the Hapticlabs DevKit in Meeting Expectations:
• Overall, the toolkit was well-received in terms of its usability and educational value in
helping participants achieve their learning objectives. Those with less technical experi-
ence particularly appreciated the clear instructions and step-by-step guidance.
• However, some participants felt that the DevKit’s software Hapticlabs Studio could ben-
efit from additional features, such as more advanced tutorials or options for customizing
haptic feedback designs, which would help them push the boundaries of their designs and
experiment more freely.

Impact of Emotion Typology and Circumplex Model Introduction
4.3.1
Structured Emotional Articulation
The introduction of Emotion Typology and the Circumplex Model of Affect was one of the
most impactful elements of the workshop. These frameworks helped participants articulate
and categorize complex emotions associated with their personal objects, which was particularly
valuable in the context of having non-native English speakers as participants but executing the
workshop in English. BP2, for example, expressed that the structured approach expanded their
emotional vocabulary, making it easier to convey nuanced feelings through their designs:
”What I really liked was that you in the beginning brought in the scope of, for me,
emotions and how these are called or how they feel because... it would be hard to
come up with the description that I came up with without looking at the emotions
that you presented us today.”
This sentiment was echoed by AP2, who noted the value of clear emotional frameworks:
”I also thought the basis of the emotions was very nice because I also hadn’t had
some of these words or emotions that clear.”
4.3.2
Visual Representation and Emotional Scope
The visual tools provided as part of the Emotion Typology allowed participants to visualize
and articulate their emotional states more effectively. The circumplex model’s division of emo-
tions into dimensions such as valence and arousal provided a structured means to explore how
specific emotions could be translated into haptic sensations. Participants reported that these
resources enabled them to connect the abstract concept of emotion with physical sensations and
subsequently into haptic feedback design.
However, while the typology was beneficial, some participants noted that the range of emotions
presented was somewhat limited. For example, participants generally brought objects associ-
ated with positive emotions, which might have restricted the exploration of a broader emotional
spectrum.
4.4
Usefulness of Embodied Metaphors and Body Maps
The workshop outcomes were assessed based on the usefulness of the toolkit in aiding partic-
ipants in designing affective haptic feedback prototypes. The analysis focuses on how partici-
pants used body maps and embodied metaphors to translate emotions into haptic feedback, as
well as the overall success of the prototyping sessions.

Body Maps
Participants used body maps to visually represent the areas of the body where
they believed haptic feedback would be most effective in conveying specific emotions. The
use of body maps proved instrumental in helping participants conceptualize the placement and
impact of haptic actuators on the body. As explained in section 4.2.
Participants found body mapping to be beneficial in recognizing, reflecting, and connecting
emotions to specific body parts. AP1 stated, “I agree with the whole method of body maps
helping to understand the emotion and where I feel it, and you can just become more aware
of your own body.” However, they faced challenges when attempting to directly translate these
emotional locations into actuator placements during prototyping. AP1 noted, “When it comes
to translating now this body map to the haptic design, I think it’s sometimes not really straight-
forward or that obvious that if you experience something in your chest or in your head, then you
should use the actuators in that place.” Specifically, placing actuators on emotionally significant
areas like the chest created discomfort: “Some places that are being emotionally influenced
(like chest, for example) shouldn’t be externally stimulated with vibrations because it creates a
weird, eerie feeling.” This feedback highlights that while body maps are useful for understand-
ing emotional experiences, designers must carefully consider the appropriateness and comfort
of actuator placement, rather than relying solely on the locations identified in the body maps.
With AP1 noting that placing actuators on emotionally significant areas, like the chest, created
an ”eerie feeling”, specifically when placed around the heart, it emphasises the importance
of carefully selection of the appropriate area of haptic affect through vibrotactile stimulation.
BP1 also highlighted how ”the same vibration pattern on the chest and back created different
emotional responses” demonstrating the importance of body maps in refining the placement of
haptic actuators to better align with emotional intentions.
AP1 stated,
”I agree with the whole method of body maps helping to understand the emotion
and where I feel it and you can just become more aware of your own body. When
you recall a memory for example you recall your attitude towards an object.”
aligning with the intent of RQ11.4 of investigating the impact of body maps and embodied
metaphor elicitation on the design and communication process of haptic feedback.
Yet, AP1 criticises:
”But when it comes to translating now this body map to the haptic design, I think it’s
sometimes not really straightforward or that obvious that if you experience some-
thing in your chest or in your head then you should use the actuators in that place or
you use the vibration in that place. Because it’s one thing to have this feeling com-
ing from the inside just naturally and just recording it and then it’s another thing to
provoke it with the external stimulator or the trigger.
Even though AP1 did not find it useful to translate the location of felt emotion directly into the
suitable location for the haptic prototype to induce the emotion, the participant further stated,


============================================================

============================================================

105
”I liked that it gave me an initial idea of where I can place the actuators, although
placing them on emotionally charged areas like the chest created a strange, eerie
feeling”
Similarly, Participant BP1 appreciated the maps for visualizing how haptic feedback could be
designed across different parts of the body, remarking that
”using body maps enabled me to also see my options, and having the same pattern
on the chest and back creates different experiences.”
This feedback illustrates the value of body maps as a design tool but also reveals limitations,
such as difficulties in translating abstract emotional experiences into physical stimuli. The feed-
back was mixed regarding their overall effectiveness. While some participants, like CP1, found
body maps useful for organizing emotions, others, such as CP2, struggled to translate these
emotional representations into effective haptic feedback. While body mapping can be a helpful
reflective tool, its role in aiding the haptic design process may require further refinement or
additional support to be fully effective. While the tool provided an entry point for this explo-
ration, the process was not universally straightforward for all participants. Feedback revealed
a significant variability in how participants engaged with body mapping. Participants, such as
CP1 and BP3, found it useful for organizing their thoughts and guiding the prototyping process.
Others, like CP2, reported difficulty in converting the abstract emotions identified on their body
maps into actionable haptic feedback. This highlights that while body mapping can serve as a
valuable reflective exercise, it may require additional support, iteration, or simply more time for
internalization (i.e. the body mapping activity) to bridge the gap between the conceptual and
the practical application of haptic design. The varying levels of success observed with body
mapping suggest that it may function more as a starting point for emotional reflection, rather
than a comprehensive solution for translating emotional states into tactile outputs.
• Emotional Localization: Participants successfully identified and targeted specific areas
of the body that corresponded with the emotional states they aimed to evoke. For example,
feedback associated with stress relief was often applied to areas such as the shoulders or
back, while feedback intended to evoke excitement was focused on areas like the chest or
hands.
• Design Precision: The use of body maps allowed participants to refine their designs with
greater precision, ensuring that the haptic feedback was not only conceptually aligned
with the intended emotion tied to the brought object but also physically effective in deliv-
ering that UX.
Embodied Metaphors:
The embodied metaphor elicitation exercise played a crucial role in
helping participants translate abstract emotional concepts into tangible haptic designs.


============================================================
PAGE 119
============================================================

RESULTS
106
• Metaphor Application: Participants were able to create haptic feedback patterns that
reflected the metaphors they had chosen. For instance, one participant associated the
feeling of calmness with the metaphor of ”waves on a beach,” leading them to design a
rhythmic, pulsing feedback that mimicked the sensation of waves gently rolling over the
body.
• Emotional Resonance: The metaphors helped participants connect emotionally with
their designs, resulting in feedback patterns that were not only technically sound but also
resonant with the desired emotional experience.
Participants, such as BP2, successfully utilized metaphors to translate their emotional connec-
tion with objects. For instance, BP2 described the metaphor of “confidence as an upright pos-
ture” and mapped this to vibrations along the upper body to reflect their emotional experience.
BP2 explained in the individual survey,
“The necklace of [BP1] represents a kind of confidence that we connected with
posture. An upright posture has some kind of interoceptive elements (the internal
lived experience, feeling your own body). We tried approaching this by introduc-
ing a stimulating trigger through vibration that ‘travels’ and connects with certain
muscles that are involved when you stand upright.”
This use of metaphors guided the translation of abstract emotions into concrete designs. The
prototype illustrating this concept is shown in Figure 47. The next section will explore how
these metaphors informed design choices and their emotional affect on the participants.
4.4.1
Facilitating Emotional Translation
Embodied metaphors and body maps were introduced to help participants translate abstract
emotions into tangible haptic feedback. This process grounded emotional experiences in phys-
ical sensations and participants explored the spatial and metaphorical dimensions of their ob-
ject’s emotions. For example, BP1 used the metaphor of a basketball dribble to evoke a feeling
of calmness, successfully incorporating this metaphor into the design of haptic feedback pat-
terns. CP1 similarly reflected on the usefulness of body maps in directing their design:
”I found the body map particularly useful in figuring out where I associate spe-
cific emotions. It gave me a clearer direction on where to start applying the haptic
feedback designs.”
4.4.2
Enhancing Communication Between Designers and Users
The Tandem Design setup, in which participants alternated between the roles of designer and
user, coupled with embodied metaphors and body maps, significantly enhanced communication.
Participants found that by discussing their personal emotional experiences, they were better able
to translate and fine-tune haptic feedback to resonate with their design partner. BP2 emphasized
the importance of communication in the design process, stating,


============================================================

107
”Through communication, I felt like it was way better that we expressed the first-
person felt experience. So we had to communicate inside out what we felt.”
4.4.3
Challenges in Translating Complex Metaphors
Despite the usefulness of embodied metaphors, some participants struggled with translating
more complex or abstract metaphors into haptic feedback. AP2 observed:
”I feel like this method can work well if you have a metaphor that can be translated
easily into haptics, but... the more complex the initial embodied metaphor, the
harder it is to translate.”
AP1 also noted that certain body map locations, such as the chest, were difficult to stimulate
comfortably with vibrations, raising the issue of user discomfort in specific body areas:
”Some places that are being emotionally influenced (like chest, for example) shouldn’t
be externally stimulated with vibrations because it creates a weird, eerie feeling.”
These challenges highlighted the need for further refinement in how embodied metaphors and
body maps are utilized, especially when dealing with complex emotional states and sensitive
body areas.
4.5
Challenges Faced During Prototyping Sessions
Tandem On-Body Prototyping Sessions
The iterative nature of the prototyping sessions al-
lowed participants to test, refine, and improve their designs based on real-time feedback from
their partners. BP1 emphasized the benefits of this approach:
“With some iterations, we managed to create the feeling we went for.”
However, participants also faced challenges due to technical limitations and the subjective na-
ture of emotional interpretation. BP2 highlighted the importance of communication in this
process:
“Through communication, I felt like it was way better that we expressed the first-
person felt experience. So we had to communicate inside out what we felt.”
This underscores that while iterative prototyping and collaboration are valuable, they require ef-
fective communication and may be hindered by individual differences and technical constraints.

• Iterative Real-Time On-Body Design Process: Participants engaged in continuous test-
ing and refinement of their affective haptic on-body prototypes, using feedback from their
partners to make adjustments. The iterative nature of the prototyping sessions allowed
participants to refine their designs. For example, BP2 highlighted how the trial-and-error
approach of their body-storming helped them explore first-person emotional experiences,
making the process of designing haptic feedback more tangible and meaningful in real-
time. This process was critical in helping them understand the nuances of single-modal
affective haptic feedback and how small changes could significantly impact the emotional
experience.
• Successful Outcomes: By the end of the workshop, all participants managed to develop
and test affective haptic feedback that resembled their personal object’s emotion. The
ideation and Lo-Fi on-body prototyping for achieving the subjective emotional affect
successfully resembled the intended emotional trigger. These outcomes demonstrated the
toolkit’s ability to support novice interaction designers in creating emotionally affective
haptic feedback, even with minimal prior experience.
4.5.1
Technical Complexity and Learning Curve
One of the main challenges participants encountered was the technical complexity of on-body
haptic design. For example, CP1 experienced connectivity issues with the hardware, stating,
”Bluetooth connection was very bad and hindered the process.”
While most participants found the hardware (Hapticlabs DevKit) relatively easy to connect, the
software interface still presented some struggles in its intuitive usage.
While participants found the hardware straightforward to connect, they faced challenges with
the software interface.
BP1 expressed frustration with the learning curve associated with the Hapticlabs Studio soft-
ware:
”Understanding the software was a bit challenging; the hardware is very straight-
forward to connect... The software wasn’t very intuitive... The interface could be
more user-friendly.”
Specific issues included difficulty in navigating the interface and a lack of guidance on the
effective integration of pre-built haptic patterns.
This difficulty was exacerbated for participants with lower coding skills, further emphasizing
the need for more intuitive, beginner-friendly software for novice interaction designers.

4.5.2
Subjectivity of Emotional Interpretation
The subjective nature of emotional interpretation presented another significant challenge. Par-
ticipants found that designing for affective experiences was inherently difficult because emo-
tions are experienced differently by different individuals. BP2 remarked:
”It was his really subjective feeling that I tried to resemble and implement... we had
to give feedback to each other and communicate really well what we were trying to
do.”
This difficulty in achieving universal emotional resonance through haptic feedback was a re-
current theme, highlighting the importance of communication and iterative feedback during the
prototyping process.
4.6
Technical Limitations of the Toolkit
4.6.1
Hardware Constraints
Participants encountered several hardware limitations during the prototyping sessions, which
impacted their ability to fully explore haptic designs. The Hapticlabs DevKit’s Bluetooth con-
nectivity issues and the limited number of actuators were particularly frustrating for partici-
pants. CP1 noted:
”Hardware challenges: Bluetooth connection was very bad and hindered the pro-
cess... wire connection didn’t work.”
BP2 expressed concern over the narrow range of actuator options:
”Only having two actuators was difficult because they unfolded their impact only
locally.”
AP1 noted a limitation in prototyping spatial haptic experiences due to the availability of only
one actuator of each type:
”Can’t prototype spatially, only one actuator of one type.”
This constraint hindered the ability to create more complex, multi-point haptic feedback pat-
terns.
These hardware constraints limited the spatial and dynamic variety of haptic feedback that par-
ticipants could create, restricting their creative potential and exploration of more complex emo-
tional designs.

4.6.2
Software Usability Issues
Participants also struggled with the software’s usability, which was not as intuitive as expected.
BP1 mentioned:
”The software wasn’t very intuitive... The interface could be more user-friendly.”
This issue hindered some participants’ ability to experiment freely and iterate on their designs,
underscoring the need for improved software that caters to novice users, offering clear instruc-
tions, pre-designed haptic patterns, and more intuitive controls.
4.7
Participant Feedback and Recommendations
4.7.1
Positive Feedback
Participants appreciated several aspects of the workshop and the toolkit. The introduction of
the Emotion Typology, the collaborative Tandem Design approach, and the hands-on nature of
the activities were frequently cited as strengths of the workshop. Participants appreciated the
hands-on activities and collaborative environment of the workshop. CP2 commented:
”They were great! Much needed to have a detailed overview of the design process...
This setup provided an opportunity to do so and freedom to do it the way you wish
as a designer.”
Qualitative feedback from participants provided valuable insights into their experiences with
the toolkit and the overall workshop structure. This section summarizes the key themes that
emerged from the feedback, highlighting both the strengths of the workshop and areas for po-
tential improvement.
• Toolkit Usability: Participants praised the user-friendliness of the toolkit, particularly
the Hapticlabs hardware and software. They found the interface intuitive and appreciated
the clear instructions provided for setting up and using the actuators.
• Collaborative Learning: The tandem approach was well-received, with participants not-
ing that working in pairs allowed them to exchange ideas, provide mutual support, and
learn from each other’s experiences. This collaborative environment was seen as a key
factor in the success of the workshop.
• Creative Freedom: Participants valued the creative freedom afforded by the workshop
structure, which encouraged them to experiment with different designs and iterate based
on feedback. They appreciated the balance between guidance and autonomy, which al-
lowed them to explore their ideas while still receiving support when needed.

4.7.2
Areas for Improvement:
Participants suggested several possible improvements to the chosen haptic hardware actuator
and software kit, including the introduction of more diverse actuators (e.g., those that can pro-
duce pressure, temperature, or texture sensations), enhanced software usability with pre-built
(affective) haptic example patterns, and easier accessible wireless powering options for actua-
tors to facilitate on-body prototyping without cumbersome wires. The following list contains
the details:
• More Diverse Materials: Some participants suggested that the toolkit could be enhanced
by including a wider variety of hardware actuators and materials, allowing for more di-
verse haptic experiences. This would enable designers to experiment with different types
of feedback and explore a broader range of emotional responses. Practical enhancements
such as providing extension cords and magnets could improve the usability of the toolkit.
AP1 suggested,
”Include more actuators for better creativity, include extension cords[...]Maybe
some magnets to attach the actuators more easily.’
These additions would facilitate easier placement of actuators on different body parts and
support more complex prototyping scenarios.
• Enhanced Feedback Mechanisms: Participants expressed a desire for more structured
feedback mechanisms within the toolkit, such as predefined feedback loops or prompts
that could guide them through the iterative design process more usefully.
• Wireless Options: Several participants mentioned that wireless actuators would have
made the prototyping process more seamless, allowing for greater flexibility in testing
and iterating on designs.
• Streamline Workshop Structure: Although the workshop was received as helpful in
teaching the concept of affective haptic design, participants had problems with the com-
pletion of the number of activities within the scheduled workshop timeframe. This made
the workshop feel rushed in some parts and should be considered for future conductions
or applications of certain methodologies of this proposed theoretical toolkit.
4.7.3
Unexpected Challenges and Benefits
Participants faced a number of technical challenges throughout the prototyping sessions. Sev-
eral participants encountered issues with the DevKit’s Bluetooth connectivity disabling the ac-
tuators, which led to interruptions in their design process. CP1 and BP1 both mentioned that
connectivity problems disrupted the flow of their iterative prototyping. Additionally, BP2 re-
marked on the limitations imposed by the narrow variety of actuators available, explaining that
it restricted their ability to experiment with more complex emotional patterns. These technical


============================================================

112
difficulties highlight the need for more robust hardware and troubleshooting documentation to
ensure smoother workflows in future iterations of the workshop.
Unexpectedly, participants also gained valuable emotional insights through the embodied metaphor
elicitation and body mapping exercises. AP1 expressed that these activities helped them become
”more aware of bodily sensations”
tied to emotions, while BP1 noted that the exercises allowed them to
”translate these sensations into physical prototypes”
in a more useful, educative manner. However, the process was not without its challenges. CP2,
for instance, struggled to apply abstract metaphors like ”comfort” to specific affective haptic
feedback. This participant feedback underscores the importance of providing additional guid-
ance and expanding the diversity of hardware (i.e., actuators, easier wireless setup) to better
support the undisrupted design process and therefore the translation of complex emotional con-
cepts into affective haptic feedback designs.
Participants provided detailed feedback on various elements of the workshop. The introduction
to the Emotion Typology and the circumplex model was widely appreciated, particularly for
their utility in helping participants categorize and articulate complex emotions. BP1 and CP2
both mentioned that these models provided a useful structure for thinking about emotion in
more concrete terms, especially when trying to translate abstract feelings into haptic feedback
designs.
However, the embodied metaphor elicitation and body mapping activities, while well-received,
revealed several challenges. CP1 expressed that while the body maps helped conceptualize the
connection between emotion and the body, translating those concepts into haptic feedback was
’not always intuitive.’ This sentiment was echoed by BP2, who struggled to apply abstract
metaphors, such as ’comfort,’ to specific haptic designs. The difficulty in bridging the concep-
tual understanding of emotions and the practical application of haptics underscores a critical
limitation of the workshop: while the exercises successfully facilitated emotional introspection,
the toolkit lacked the necessary diversity in actuators and design options to fully realize these
ideas in practice.
During the prototyping sessions, the technical challenges that emerged also impacted partici-
pants’ creative processes. The limited variety of actuators constrained some participants’ ability
to explore more diverse emotional representations through haptics. BP2 explicitly mentioned
that the narrow range of actuators ’limited the ability to experiment with more complex emo-
tional patterns.’ Additionally, CP1 and BP1 both faced connectivity issues, which further hin-
dered their ability to iterate on their designs smoothly. These technical limitations suggest that
while the workshop succeeded in promoting emotional exploration, the current iteration of the
toolkit does not yet fully support the technical needs of novice interaction designers in translat-
ing these explorations into tangible prototypes.


============================================================

RESULTS
113
Overall, while participants recognized the value of the workshop and its ability to support emo-
tional engagement through haptic design, their feedback indicates several key areas for im-
provement. As demonstrated in the workshop feedback, participants, such as CP1, described
how the tactile sensation of a plush toy evoked feelings of gratitude and nostalgia. This feedback
reinforces how specific textures or patterns can anchor emotions within tangible interactions,
highlighting the potential of haptic design to deepen emotional engagement through personal-
ized tactile feedback.
The Hapticlabs DevKit, while lowering technical barriers, presented challenges that impacted
the design process. Participants faced issues such as limited actuator types and connectivity
problems. CP1 expressed frustration:
“Hardware challenges: Bluetooth connection was very bad and hindered the pro-
cess, wire connection didn’t work, and we had some issues with the interactions
with the program as well.”
Similarly, BP2 noted,
“Only having two actuators was difficult because they unfolded their impact only
locally.”
These technical limitations suggest that the toolkit requires more diverse actuator options and
more reliable technical infrastructure to ensure smoother workflows and greater creative flexi-
bility. An image of the Hapticlabs DevKit used is provided in Figure 4.
4.7.4
Suggestions for Improvement
Participants also offered constructive feedback for improving the workshop and toolkit. Com-
mon suggestions included the introduction of more diverse actuators, improved software usabil-
ity, and wireless options for actuators. BP2 remarked:
”Material that spreads a sensation over the skin! Or a sequence of actuators... The
small local impact is not versatile enough.”
AP1 suggested allowing for more creative freedom in the workshop, particularly in the explo-
ration of emotions:
”Maybe in the future it makes sense to let people describe their own words, feelings,
and not try to limit those to emotions... so that the exploration part is there.”
Participants emphasized the importance of wearability in haptic prototyping.
BP1 recom-
mended,
”The toolkit could be more focused on wearables as well; it’s lacking that aspect
now—either wireless or easier to attach on the body.”
This suggests that making the actuators more wearable could enhance the iteration speed of
Experience Prototyping and the realism of the prototypes.

Summary of Results
The findings demonstrate that the proposed methodological toolkit aided participants in design-
ing emotionally affective haptic feedback by:
• Enhancing emotional articulation: The Emotion Typology and circumplex model pro-
vided a structured approach for participants to articulate and categorize their emotions.
• Facilitating emotional translation: Embodied metaphors and body maps were instru-
mental in helping participants conceptualize and design haptic feedback patterns.
• Improving communication: The Tandem Design approach fostered empathy and ef-
fective communication between participants, allowing for better translation of emotional
experiences into haptic designs.
The methodological toolkit aided participants in articulating emotions, translating them into
haptic designs, and improving communication during the design process. However, challenges
such as technical limitations and the subjective nature of emotions highlight areas for improve-
ment in making the toolkit more versatile and user-friendly for novice designers.

Discussion
This section interprets the key findings from our study, connecting them to the research ques-
tions outlined in Section 3.2, the theoretical frameworks discussed in the Introduction and Re-
lated Work (Section 1 and Section 2), and the broader goals of the study. Through an exam-
ination of direct citations from participants and relevant literature, this section discusses the
usefulness of the proposed methodological toolkit in assisting novice interaction designers in
the creation of emotionally affective haptic feedback prototyping. The identified limitations and
challenges, establishing a foundation for the conclusion, and future research directions are also
addressed.
5.1
Impact of Emotion Typology and Circumplex Model on Affective Hap-
tic Design
The introduction of the Emotion Typology and the Circumplex Model of Affect had a report-
edly significant impact on participants’ ability to articulate and categorize emotions during the
workshop, providing insights into RQ2: ”How can low-fidelity on-body prototyping sessions
be structured to facilitate the design and iterative improvement of affective haptic feedback?
” from Section 1.4. These tools offered a structured approach to understanding and express-
ing emotions, which is crucial in affective haptic design, where nuanced subjective emotional
experiences are translated into tactile sensations aimed at invoking those same experiences.

DISCUSSION

Participants appreciated the provided comprehensive resources related to emotional mapping
during the workshop. These resources are available on the TU Delft website, including detailed
descriptions and relatable scenarios for each emotion, which were particularly beneficial for
non-native English speakers in phase 3.2.4 of the workshop, especially for expanding their
emotional vocabulary. Participant BP2 found the Emotion Typology helpful in articulating
emotions, stating:
”What I really liked was that you in the beginning brought in the scope of, for me,
emotions and how these are called or how they feel because when I look at my
object that I brought today, it would be hard to come up with the description that I
came up with without looking at the emotions that you presented us today.”
This indicates that the provided emotional frameworks assisted participants in expressing their
feelings more precisely and aligns with the use of Russell’s (1980) Circumplex Model of Affect
and the refinement proposal by Posner et al. (2005), which provides a structured approach to
organize, understand, and reduce the complexity of emotions into valence and arousal dimen-
sions [43, 45]. Ju et al. (2005) proved the utility of such models in Affective Computing and
design [28].
AP2 expressed that the Emotion Typology helped expand their emotional vocabulary, stating:
”It actually did open my mind what’s possible in terms of vibration patterns and
styles, and how to convey emotions with them. I thought vibration is very one-
dimensional, present or not. But there is a lot of variation possible, which was new
to me.”
However, some participants felt constrained by the predefined emotional categories. AP1 sug-
gested allowing for more personal and nuanced expressions of emotions:
”I think it also makes sense to not limit a person into the exploration journey... It
doesn’t have to be an emotion. It can be just a feeling... something that I can’t
translate to an emotion, but I mean, I can if I’m forced to, but I would choose
different words for it.”
This highlights the limitations of relying solely on predefined emotion typologies and suggests
that future iterations of the toolkit should allow for more flexibility in how emotions are ex-
pressed and explored. This is consistent with Eid and Al Osman(2016) emphasis on the impor-
tance of personal and contextual factors in affective design [18] and the principles of emotional
design proposed by Norman(2004) [40].
As mentioned, the Emotions Typology was particularly beneficial for non-native English speak-
ers. AP2 remarked:
”I also thought the basis of the emotions was very nice because I also hadn’t had
some of these words or emotions that clear.”

This underscores the importance of accessible language and resources in supporting emotional
articulation, which is essential in the initial stages of affective haptic design.
However, despite the success in emotional articulation, some participants expressed that the
Emotion Typology and Circumplex Model of Affect might have constrained the emotional
scope explored. The personal objects participants brought to the workshop were mostly as-
sociated with positive emotions, limiting the exploration of a more diverse emotional spectrum
or even leaving the terminology ”emotion” and including a broader definition of sensations
and feelings as possible affect states to design for. This suggests that future iterations of the
workshop should consider introducing additional emotional dimensions, including negative or
ambivalent emotions, to ensure a more comprehensive exploration of affective design possibili-
ties. However, these research efforts must be ethically considerate and well-structured to ensure
the participant’s safety and emotional well-being.

Embodied Metaphors and Body Maps: Enhancing Emotional Trans-
lation and Communication
The integration of embodied metaphors and body maps was instrumental in helping participants
translate and communicate abstract emotional concepts into tangible haptic designs, addressing
RQ1: ”How do embodied metaphors in combination with body maps impact the design and
communication process of affective haptic feedback for novice designers?” from Section 1.4.
5.2.1
Embodied Metaphors
The use of embodied metaphors was instrumental in helping participants shape abstract emo-
tional concepts into tangible haptic designs. Bakker et al. (2012) highlighted the effectiveness
of embodied metaphors in interaction design, arguing that they facilitate a deeper connection
between the user’s physical experiences and the design outcome [5].
Participants used embodied metaphors to conceptualize haptic patterns. This was successfully
applied in the case of BP1, who used the metaphor of a basketball dribble to evoke feelings of
nostalgic calmness in their haptic design for BP2. By anchoring emotions in physical sensations
and spatial representations, participants were able to create more meaningful haptic feedback
designs. This methodology facilitated a deeper emotional connection to the designs, fostering
more meaningful and individualized user-centered single-modal haptic interaction making us-
age of the emotional memory of the user aligning with the principles of emotional design by
Norman (2004) [40] mentioned in Section 2.
The participants’ feedback illustrates that a useful basis for communication was fostered, even
though it was still challenging to express subjective emotional experiences to one another,
which group B adapted to by extending the tandem on-body prototyping with the term ”body-
storming”.
BP1 contributed the following to the group discussion:

”So he [BP2] had an object as a small basketball and then when he shared his
story with me about how he used to go to playing with his dad, etc. I understood
what kind of emotion he connected with the object and maybe without the object I
wouldn’t have been able to understand that good.”
This feedback contributes towards the clarification of RQ1 and RQ2 in Section 1.4 and demon-
strates how embodied metaphors serve as a bridge between the emotional significance of an
object and the haptic patterns designed to evoke similar feelings and how they can be integrated
into haptic design processes. By anchoring the design in a familiar physical action or sensation,
BP1 could create a more meaningful and resonant haptic experience for BP2.
BP2 further remarked,
”And then when I was designing, I tried to recreate a dribble of a basketball and
that’s maybe not necessarily the feeling that he had or the exhaustion he felt or the
playfulness during the match but that was what could I correlate with haptics. And
in order to find that connection, the pattern, I think this metaphor was really useful
for me to go through there and see that. And maybe I couldn’t have been able to do
or find this easily if we hadn’t the metaphor or the story behind.”
This puts the object in a real-life setting, supporting the user empathizing process for user-
centered design and therefore supporting the theory of the Experience Prototyping approach
[11].
CP1 explained how the physical attributes of their object inspired their haptic design:
”I mainly used the part of ’physical characteristics.’ I found the size and texture of my object
very inspiring... We translated the different textures into different haptic patterns.”
However, some participants found it challenging to translate complex or abstract metaphors into
haptic feedback.
AP2 observed:
”I feel like this method can work well if you have a metaphor that can be translated
easily into haptics, but... The more complex the initial embodied metaphor, the
harder it is to translate.”
This suggests that while the methodology is effective for straightforward emotions, additional
strategies may be needed to address more abstract or nuanced emotional states.
AP1 mentioned the desire for more creative freedom beyond straightforward translations:
”It helped identifying certain qualities or emotions I can focus on when designing haptics, but I
also don’t find it very interesting translating it this straightforwardly. I want to be more creative,
and body maps are better for that.”
This suggests that while embodied metaphors are valuable, they may require careful selection
and simplification to be effectively integrated into haptic designs, particularly for novice inter-
action designers.

5.2.2
Body Maps
Body maps contributed to the emotional translation process by helping participants identify
where emotions are felt in the body and consider appropriate actuator placement. Nummen-
maa et al. (2014) explored body maps of emotions, showing how certain emotional states
(e.g. Anger, Fear, Disgust, Happiness, Sadness, Neutral, Anxiety, Love, Depression, Contempt,
Pride, Shame, Envy) have overlapping commonality in their physical experience in the body, re-
inforcing the important concept of norming considerate spatial placement of actuators to foster
the research of recreational affective haptic feedback principles. Cochrane et al. (2022) further
emphasized the importance of body mapping in understanding and documenting the somatic
aspects of emotional experiences in design [15].
AP1 shared:
”I agree with the whole method of body maps helping to understand the emotion
and where I feel it, and you can just become more aware of your own body.”
This self-awareness is crucial in affective design, as it allows designers to create more personal-
ized and impactful haptic feedback. The activity encouraged participants to consider the phys-
iological aspects of emotional experiences, such as the heightened sensitivity of certain body
parts like the face, hands, and feet. This further emphasizes the role of embodied cognition
(Hollan et al., 2000) [25] - emphasising the significance of bodily experiences and sensorimo-
tor interactions in shaping cognitive processes - in the field of affective design, where the body
becomes both a site of emotional experience and a design canvas constantly affecting each other.
However, challenges arose when attempting to stimulate certain body parts with haptic feed-
back. AP1 further explained:
”When it comes to translating now this body map to the haptic design, I think it’s
sometimes not really straightforward... Because it’s one thing to have this feeling
coming from the inside... and then it’s another thing to provoke it with the external
stimulator.”
CP1 noted a disconnect between initial mapping and later stages:
”We focused a lot on creating a certain sensation with the vibration motors and then didn’t think
all that much about where this sensation would work best because prototyping was easiest on
the hands and we didn’t really adapt it after—maybe because of lack of time.” This highlights
the importance of allocating sufficient time for exploration and iteration in the design process.
Future workshops should consider extending the duration or streamlining activities to allow
participants to experiment with different actuator placements and refine their designs based on
the insights gained from body mapping.
Participants reported discomfort when actuators were placed on sensitive areas like the chest or
stomach, highlighting the need for careful consideration of actuator placement and the type of
haptic stimuli used. This matches with Tsetserukou et al.’s (2009) findings on the importance
of user comfort and the emotional appropriateness of stimuli in Affective Haptics [55].

5.2.3
Complementary Use of Embodied Metaphors and Body Maps
While embodied metaphors provided a valuable method for translating abstract emotions into
haptic designs, the integration of body maps further enriched this process by helping design-
ers consider the physical manifestation of emotions in the body. This complementary use of
methodologies offered a multi-dimensional approach to affective haptic design, enhancing the
depth and relevance of the prototypes developed. While both tools were valuable individually,
their combined use presented some challenges. BP2 mentioned:
”In the second step... the body maps were just, for me, documentation... We didn’t
use it for that type [on-body prototyping feedback] of communication.”
This indicates that participants may have struggled to integrate the insights from embodied
metaphors and body maps seamlessly into their prototyping design process but they provided
a valuable foundation for the preparation process. Future workshops could provide more guid-
ance on how to effectively combine these methodologies before the prototyping process or en-
hance the usefulness of emotional translation and communication within (tandem) design teams
during the on-body prototyping processes.
CP2 also emphasized the value of the methodology templates offered and the workshop workspace
setup in the room (see Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure B) and on Miro (see Appendix B in the design
process:
”They were great! Much needed to have a detailed overview of the design process.
As you need to zoom in and out multiple times on the emotions, body parts, feel-
ings, haptics, etc. This setup provided an opportunity to do so and freedom to do it
the way you wish as a designer.”
Overall the use of embodied metaphors and body maps in the workshop helped participants
articulate their emotions more effectively. Turmo Vidal et al. (2023) have shown how body
maps serve as an insightful tool for understanding and documenting where emotions manifest
physically [56], which aligns well with the proposed approach in the workshop. Additionally,
Nardon and Hari (2021) emphasize the role of metaphors in bridging the gap between abstract
emotional concepts and physical sensations, enhancing user engagement and emotional com-
munication [39].
5.3
Technical and Conceptual Challenges in Affective Haptic Design
In response to RQ3: ”What challenges do novice designers face when designing affective haptic
feedback, and how can these challenges be overcome?”, the study identified several obstacles
that novice designers encountered, primarily related to technical complexity and the subjective
nature of emotional interpretation. The varying levels of familiarity with haptic prototyping
and coding skills among participants necessitated a workshop structure that could accommo-
date both relatively experienced individuals and complete novices. While the Haptic Labs

toolkit provided a user-friendly interface, the technical limitations and the need for a deeper
understanding of haptic software hindered some participants’ ability to fully engage with the
prototyping process. Furthermore, the subjective interpretation of emotions presented a chal-
lenge in designing universally resonant haptic feedback, as personal experiences and emotional
responses varied widely among participants.
AP2’s observation that
”applying the haptics to the body feels like you always come back to the same
thing... I find it hard to see a completely different application”
underscores the constraints posed by limited actuator types and placement options. This sug-
gests that expanding the variety of actuators and exploring alternative body areas could facilitate
more diverse and innovative haptic designs, allowing designers to move beyond standard appli-
cations and explore new possibilities in affective haptic feedback.
Participant BP2 suggested that incorporating predefined haptic patterns and intensity settings
into the software could enhance the usability and usefulness of the Hapticlabs Studio in the
context of this affective haptic workshop toolkit.
”The software wasn’t very intuitive. If you work with the body, you can already
provide patterns and intensities reflecting on the type of feedback you want to get.”
This feature could help novice designers more quickly create and test haptic feedback aligned
with specific emotional states.
5.3.1
Technical Complexity and Toolkit Limitations
Participants faced several technical challenges with the Hapticlabs DevKit and Hapticlabs Stu-
dio Software, including connectivity issues and a restriction of their design exploration through
the limited amount of actuators - one of each kind, and two connectable at the same time to the
hardware satellite - contained within the Hapticlabs DevKit. CP1 experienced hardware issues
that hindered the design process and noted following feedback down in their concluding survey:
”Hardware challenges: Bluetooth connection was very bad and hindered the pro-
cess, wire connection didn’t work, and we had some issues with the interactions
with the program as well (dragging, resizing, copying, selecting, going back).”
Similarly, BP2 highlighted the limitations of the Hapticlabs DevKit satellite that allowed the
usage of two actuators at the same time:
”Only having two actuators was difficult because they unfolded their impact only
locally.”

Technical limitations of the Haptic Labs toolkit, such as restricted actuator types and software
usability issues, posed significant challenges. Participants like CP1 experienced connectivity
problems and software glitches, which impeded the seamless execution of their design pro-
cesses. Additionally, the limited number of actuators constrained the complexity and spatial
distribution of haptic feedback patterns, potentially limiting the emotional expressiveness of
the designs. These technical barriers suggest a need for more versatile and beginner-friendly
prototyping tools to fully realize the potential of low-fidelity haptic prototyping in affective
design.
These technical issues hindered participants’ ability to fully explore and prototype their LoFi
designs, suggesting the need for more robust and versatile non-coding hardware toolkits. This
aligns with Seifi et al.’s (2019) emphasis on the importance of accessible, versatile, and user-
friendly haptic design tools in their Haptipedia project [47].
AP1 also mentioned the constraints imposed by the hardware of the Hapticlabs Devkit:
”It’s hard to design something when you only have one instance of a type of actua-
tor... the kit didn’t limit us in terms of ideation but implementation.”
BP2 suggested expanding the types of sensations available:
”Material that spreads a sensation over the skin! Or a sequence of actuators... The
small local impact is not versatile enough.”
AP1 proposed practical additions to the kit:
”Maybe some magnets to attach the actuators more easily.”
This highlights the gap between creative ideas and the practical ability to realize them with the
available tools.
5.3.2
Subjectivity of Emotional Interpretation
The subjective nature of emotions posed challenges in designing universally applicable affec-
tive haptic feedback, further proving the need for accessible research and design tools for af-
fective haptic feedback to standardize haptic stimuli in a database as proposed by Eid and Al
Osman(2016) [18] and mentioned in Section 1.5. BP2 observed:
”It was his really subjective feeling that I tried to resemble and implement... we had
to give feedback to each other and communicate really well what we were trying to
do.”
AP1 highlighted the difficulty in provoking internal feelings with external stimuli:

DISCUSSION
122
”It’s one thing to have this feeling coming from the inside... and then it’s another
thing to provoke it with the external stimulator.”
This underscores the importance of communication and empathy in the design process, as well
as iterative feedback to align the designer’s intent with the user’s experience. Ju et al. (2021)
emphasized that empathy plays a crucial role in effective emotional design, highlighting that
haptic interfaces need to convey nuanced emotional meanings to match user expectations ac-
curately. Similarly, Vyas et al. (2023) identified individual emotional differences as a central
challenge for designers of affective systems, suggesting the need for iterative prototyping and
real-time feedback mechanisms. Eid and Al Osman (2016) further discussed the complexities of
Affective Computing, noting that individual variability in emotional response requires systems
that are adaptive and capable of multimodal interaction to ensure a meaningful user experience.
These works illustrate that aligning technological intent with user experience in affective design
demands a comprehensive, iterative, and user-centered approach [18, 28, 57] and suggest that
designing affective haptic feedback requires a nuanced understanding of both the emotional and
physiological aspects of the haptic UX.
BP2’s observation,
”It was his really subjective feeling that I tried to resemble and implement... we had
to give feedback to each other and communicate really well what we were trying to
do,”
highlights the challenge of interpreting and translating another person’s subjective emotional
experience into a haptic design. This underscores the importance of effective communication
and empathy in collaborative design processes, as well as the need for methods that can help
bridge the gap between individual emotional perceptions.
Similarly, AP1’s reflection,
”It’s one thing to have this feeling coming from the inside... and then it’s another
thing to provoke it with the external stimulator,”
emphasizes the complexity of eliciting internal emotional states through external stimuli. This
points to the viability of incorporating both cognitive and somatic approaches in affective haptic
design to create more authentic and tailored affective user experiences.

Tandem Design Approach: Enhancing Collaboration and Iterative
Learning
One of the most significant contributions of the thesis and the workshop was the introduction of
the Tandem Design approach, where participants alternated between the roles of designer and
user. This collaborative methodology facilitated peer learning and fostered empathy between
participants as they worked together to translate emotions into haptic feedback.

Low-fidelity on-body prototyping sessions were useful in facilitating immediate feedback and
iterative design improvements, allowing participants to refine their haptic feedback patterns
in real-time. This hands-on approach enabled participants to experiment with different haptic
modalities and intensities, enhancing their understanding of how tactile feedback can evoke
specific emotional responses. BP1’s reflection,
”With some iterations, we managed to create the feeling we went for,”
highlights the potential of this iterative process in achieving the desired emotional affect.
5.4.1
Tandem Design Approach
The Tandem Design approach, where participants alternated between the roles of designer and
user, facilitated collaboration and empathy. This approach aligns with participatory and user-
centered design principles, as advocated by Buchenau and Suri (2000) in their work on Experi-
ence Prototyping [11].
Participants found value in this collaborative methodology. BP1 reflected:
”By hearing [BP2]’s story, I was able to do the design way easier, but still there is
a gap on how I interpret the haptic feedback and how he interprets it and that also
connects to the emotionality of the process.”
BP2 added:
”Through communication, I felt like it was way better that we expressed the first-
person felt experience.”
This approach allowed participants to gain insights into each other’s emotional experiences and
tailor their designs accordingly.
However, the subjectivity of emotions still posed challenges, as participants had to navigate dif-
ferences in emotional interpretation and ensure that their designs resonated with their partners.
BP2 highlighted the importance of communication in navigating subjective emotional experi-
ences:
”It was his really subjective feeling that I tried to resemble and implement... We had
to give feedback to each other and communicate really well what we were trying to
do.”

5.4.2
Impact of the Tandem Design Approach versus single-designer Setting
The Tandem Design approach employed in our study significantly enhanced the affective haptic
design process by embodying principles of Experience Prototyping as described by Buchenau
and Suri (2000) [11]. This approach aligns with their assertion that ”Experience Prototyping
simulates important aspects of the whole or parts of the relationships between people, places,
and objects as they unfold over time” (p. 431), contributing to design in three key ways: under-
standing existing user experiences, exploring and evaluating design ideas, and communicating
ideas to an audience.
By alternating roles between designer and user, participants engaged in a form of experiential
learning that allowed them to gain firsthand appreciation of each other’s emotional and somatic
experiences. This facilitated a deeper understanding of the essence of the emotional states they
aimed to evoke through haptic feedback. BP2 reflected on this process:
”Through communication, I felt like it was way better that we expressed the first-
person felt experience... we had to give feedback to each other and communicate
really well what we were trying to do.”
This collaborative dynamic mirrors Buchenau and Suri’s (2000) emphasis on the importance of
shared experiences in developing a common vision within a multidisciplinary team:
”To work effectively as a design team it is important to develop a common vision of
what the team is trying to bring into being. Therefore, it is a powerful asset to have
tools and techniques, which create a shared experience, providing a foundation for
a common point of view” [11]
In the context of our study, the Tandem Design approach enabled participants to explore and
evaluate design ideas more effectively. By experiencing the haptic feedback designed by their
partners, participants could provide immediate, subjective feedback, facilitating iterative refine-
ment. BP1 noted:
”By hearing [BP2]’s story, I was able to do the design way easier.”
This experiential engagement resonates with the idea that
”Information becomes more vivid and engaging when it resonates with personal
experience” [11]
, leading to designs that are more attuned to users’ emotional needs.
Conversely, a single-designer setting, where individuals design haptic feedback for themselves,
lacks this level of collaborative insight. While designing for oneself allows for an intimate
understanding of personal emotions, it may also introduce limitations related to personal biases
and a narrower perspective. AP1 expressed challenges in articulating personal feelings:


============================================================

5
DISCUSSION
125
”It’s one thing to have this feeling coming from the inside... and then it’s another
thing to provoke it with the external stimulator.”
This introspective approach might limit the exploration of diverse emotional expressions and re-
duce opportunities for validation through external feedback. Buchenau and Suri (2000) caution
that
”The tools we use to design, such as prototypes, influence the way we think. Solu-
tions, and probably even imagination, are inspired and limited by the prototyping
tools we have at our disposal” [11]
. In a single-designer setting, the lack of collaborative tools like the Tandem Design approach
may constrain the designer’s ability to think beyond their own experiences.
Moreover, the Tandem Design approach helps designers
”[..] get away from technological limitations [and] focus on exploring the human
perspective, somatic experience.” [11]
Participants in our study emphasized the value of focusing on the user’s bodily experiences
rather than being constrained by technical aspects. BP2 stated:
”We were kind of narrowing ourselves a bit because we were having this kind
of metaphor in our head and trying to re-enact it through the vibration... But for
the first part, I would definitely say that it was nice to think about where emotion
happens and how that could be.”
This reflects the importance of prioritizing the human experience in design, a core tenet of
Experience Prototyping.
However, the Tandem Design approach also presented challenges. Participants had to navigate
subjective interpretations of emotions and ensure clear communication to align their design
intentions. BP2 observed:
”It was his really subjective feeling that I tried to resemble and implement... and
that also connects to the emotionality of the process.”
This highlights a potential limitation, as effective Experience Prototyping requires careful con-
sideration of
”[..]setting the stage[..]”
and being explicit about context, as Buchenau and Suri (2000) suggest:


============================================================
PAGE 139
============================================================

DISCUSSION
126
”To create an appropriate prototype we need to determine [..] what context sur-
rounds the user experience.”[11]
In comparing the two approaches, it becomes evident that the Tandem Design method enhances
the design process by fostering empathy, collaborative exploration, and richer communication of
ideas. It supports the three key contributions of Experience Prototyping identified by Buchenau
and Suri (2000):
1. Understanding existing user experiences and context: By engaging with a partner’s
emotional experiences, designers gain insights that might be inaccessible in a single-
designer setting.
2. Exploring and evaluating design ideas: Collaborative prototyping allows for immediate
feedback and iterative refinement, aligning with the notion that:
”Experience Prototyping can provide inspiration, confirmation or rejection of
ideas based upon the quality of experience they engender.” [11]
3. Communicating ideas to an audience: Shared experience facilitates a common under-
standing, essential for multidisciplinary collaboration.
In a single-designer setting, while the designer may have a deep understanding of their own
emotions, the lack of external input may limit the design’s applicability and resonance with oth-
ers. As AP1 suggested, allowing for personal expression is valuable, but incorporating others’
perspectives enriches the design process:
”Maybe in the future it makes sense to let people describe their own words, feelings,
and then try to limit those. But initially, so that the exploration part is there.”
In conclusion, the Tandem Design approach, embodying the principles of Experience Prototyp-
ing, significantly enhances the affective haptic design process by enabling designers to engage
more deeply with users’ emotional and somatic experiences. It overcomes some limitations of
designing solely for oneself by fostering empathy, promoting collaborative exploration, and im-
proving communication of design ideas. This approach aligns with Buchenau and Suri’s (2000)
emphasis on the value of active engagement and shared experiences in design, ultimately lead-
ing to more meaningful and resonant haptic feedback systems.

Methodological Considerations
The study’s methodology provided valuable insights but also presented certain limitations.

5.5.1
Workshop Structure
While the workshop provided valuable insights, some participants found the structure confusing
or rushed. AP1 commented:
”I thought there were multiple activities throughout the workshop that you kind of
skipped and moved to the bigger ones... which kind of made me feel confused.”
AP2 echoed:
”There was a part where we kind of did some small things very quickly and then
moved on right away to the next thing. But it felt like just a little bit quick or
something.”
These remarks indicate a necessity for more explicit instructions, improved pacing, and more
seamless transitions between activities in forthcoming workshops.
BP1 appreciated the interactive nature of the workshop:
”I love that you made it more interactive... Having like your part of like how I did
it then was easier for me to understand the whole situation and I went onwards.”
CP2 described the initial challenge and eventual benefit of the workshop:
”It was new to me which made it challenging at first. However, the structured and
organized approach used during the workshop made it a guided process.”
The suggestion by CP1 to include a physical prototyping phase—
”brainstorm on metaphors and where you could possibly put the device... and
maybe also prototype with fabrics or other things before using the software”
— indicates a need for more tactile exploration in the design process. Incorporating this step
could help designers better visualize and test how the haptic feedback device integrates with the
body, potentially leading to more innovative and user-friendly designs.
Participants expressed a desire for more exploratory and creative processes within the workshop.
BP2 mentioned, ’
”I would love to keep an explorative and creative process, something like body-
storming.”
Incorporating such methodologies could foster innovation and allow designers to experiment
more freely with haptic feedback concepts.
After considering how the body map and embodied metaphor elicitation sheet templates were
used during the prototyping process, they were useful in establishing a baseline using the mate-
rials provided for collaborative prototyping. However, during the prototyping phase, the work-
shop structure should encourage unrestricted exploration, regardless of whether it incorporates
previously introduced methodologies from the tandem on-body prototyping.

CONCLUSION

5.5.2
Use of Personal Objects
Using personal objects helped ground the emotional exploration but also limited the scope of
emotions considered. CP1 mentioned:
”Having the comfort objects here for inspiration was very helpful, though I do think
they guided our design very strongly, maybe a bit too strongly.”
This indicates that while personal objects provide a relatable starting point, they may constrain
creative exploration if relied upon the contained emotion or interaction with it exclusively. Fu-
ture workshops could encourage participants to explore a wider range of emotions beyond those
associated with their personal objects and just use them for the introduction of metaphorical
thinking.
While personal objects helped ground the emotional exploration, participants like CP1 felt that
they might have guided the design too strongly, potentially limiting creativity:
”I do think they guided our design very strongly, maybe a bit too strongly.”
This suggests that while personal objects provide a relatable starting point, they may constrain
designers to specific emotions associated with those objects. Future workshops could encour-
age participants to explore a wider range of emotions beyond those directly associated with
their personal items, promoting a more comprehensive understanding of affective haptic design
principles.
AP1 advocated for allowing participants to define their own emotional terms:
”Maybe in the future it makes sense to let people describe their own words, feelings,
and not try to limit those to emotions... So that the exploration part is there.”
Although using personal objects helped ground the emotional exploration by providing tangi-
ble references, this approach may have inadvertently limited the scope of emotions considered.
Participants primarily associated their objects with positive emotions, which constrained the
exploration to a narrower emotional spectrum. To encourage a wider range of emotional explo-
ration, future workshops could introduce neutral or unfamiliar objects or encourage participants
to consider emotions beyond those directly associated with their personal items. This would
promote a more comprehensive understanding and application of affective haptic design princi-
ples.

CONCLUSION
129
By integrating established psychological models such as the Circumplex Model of Affect [45],
Emotion Typology [43], along with embodied metaphor elicitation [5] and body mapping [15],
the toolkit aimed to bridge the gap between abstract emotional concepts and tangible haptic
prototypes. The findings from this study address the initial research questions (see in Section
1.4) and contribute valuable insights into the fields of Affective Haptics and HCI.
6.1
Summary of Key Contributions
The most significant contribution of this research is the demonstration of how a structured
methodological toolkit can aid novice interaction designers in the complex task of creating
affective haptic feedback. The integration of theoretical frameworks and practical methodolo-
gies provided participants with tools to articulate emotions, translate them into haptic designs,
and iteratively refine their prototypes based on user feedback.
6.1.1
Emotion Articulation and Translation
The use of the Emotion Typology and the Circumplex Model of Affect significantly enhanced
participants’ ability to articulate and categorize emotions. As BP2 noted:
”What I really liked was that you in the beginning brought in the scope of, for me,
emotions and how these are called or how they feel because... it would be hard to
come up with the description that I came up with without looking at the emotions
that you presented us today.”
This structured approach enabled participants, including non-native English speakers like AP2,
to expand their emotional vocabulary and provided a foundation for designing haptic feedback
that aligns with specific emotional states. This aligns with Russell’s (1980) and Posner et al.’s
(2005) emphasis on the utility of such models in organizing emotional experiences [43, 45].
6.1.2
Embodied Metaphors and Body Maps
The methodologies of embodied metaphors and body maps proved instrumental in bridging
the gap between abstract emotions and tangible haptic designs. Participants like BP1 and BP2
successfully used embodied metaphors to inform their designs. Participant BP1 explained:
”When I was designing, I tried to recreate a dribble of a basketball... And maybe I
wouldn’t have been able to... find this easily if we hadn’t the metaphor or the story
behind.”
This approach resonates with Bakker et al.’s (2012) findings on the effectiveness of embodied
metaphors in interaction design [5]. Body maps further aided in visualizing where emotions are
felt in the body, assisting in actuator placement decisions. AP1 highlighted:

CONCLUSION

”I agree with the whole method of body maps helping to understand the emotion
and where I feel it, and you can just become more aware of your own body.”
These tools collectively enhanced the emotional translation process, enabling participants to
design haptic feedback that is more aligned with users’ emotional experiences.
6.1.3
Tandem Design Approach
A Tandem Design approach was used in the workshop of this study, where participants alter-
nated between the roles of designer and user, fostering collaboration, empathy, and iterative
learning. This participatory methodology allowed for real-time feedback and refinement, es-
sential in affective haptic design where emotional nuances are critical. BP2 reflected:
”Through communication, I felt like it was way better that we expressed the first-
person felt experience.”
This approach aligns with Buchenau and Suri’s (2000) concept of Experience Prototyping, em-
phasizing the importance of designers immersing themselves in the user’s experience to create
more effective designs [11].

Toolkit Usefulness and Limitations
The use of the Hapticlabs DevKit lowered some technical barriers by eliminating the need for
coding, allowing participants to focus more on the creative aspects of haptic design. However,
limitations in hardware diversity and software usability constrained participants’ ability to fully
explore and prototype their designs. CP1 mentioned:
”Hardware challenges: Bluetooth connection was very bad and hindered the pro-
cess... we had some issues with the interactions with the program as well.”
These limitations highlight the need for more versatile and user-friendly tools to support novice
interaction designers, as emphasized by Seifi et al. (2019) in their Haptipedia project [47].

Addressing the Research Questions
The following section will address the research questions of this thesis one by one, which were
proposed in section 1.4.

CONCLUSION

6.2.1
RQ1: Impact of Embodied Metaphors in Combination with Body Maps
Embodied metaphors and body maps improved the design and communication process for
novice interaction designers by providing concrete tools to articulate and translate experien-
tial emotions into haptic designs. Participants reported that these tools helped them map emo-
tional experiences to physical sensations, leading to more meaningful and personalized haptic
feedback.
For instance, participant BP1 used the metaphor of a basketball dribble to create haptic patterns
that resonated with their partner’s emotional narrative, enhancing empathy and user-centered
design. BP1 noted:
”By hearing [BP2]’s story, I was able to do the design way easier.”
Additionally, body maps enabled designers to identify where emotions are physically felt, in-
forming actuator placement and haptic intensity. Participant AP1 expressed:
”I agree with the whole method of body maps helping to understand the emotion
and where I feel it, and you can just become more aware of your own body.”
These tools also enhanced communication among designers and between designers and users.
By using shared metaphors and visual representations of emotional experiences, participants
found it easier to convey abstract feelings and collaborate effectively.
However, challenges were encountered when dealing with complex or abstract metaphors that
were difficult to translate into haptic feedback. Participant AP2 observed:
”I feel like this method can work well if you have a metaphor that can be translated
easily into haptics, but... the more complex the initial embodied metaphor, the
harder it is to translate.”
Furthermore, certain body areas were sensitive or uncomfortable for actuator placement, limit-
ing the use of body maps in some cases. Participants reported discomfort when actuators were
placed on areas like the chest or stomach.
To mitigate these challenges, future applications should provide additional guidance on select-
ing and simplifying metaphors, perhaps incorporating workshops on metaphor creation and
translation. Alternative strategies, such as offering a library of sample metaphors or encour-
aging iterative testing with user feedback, can aid in translating complex emotions. Designers
should also consider user comfort and preferences when determining actuator placement, pos-
sibly by allowing users to select preferred stimulation areas.
Overall, embodied metaphors and body maps proved to be valuable tools that, when carefully
adapted, can greatly enhance the affective haptic design process for novice designers by foster-
ing empathy, improving communication, and grounding abstract emotions in tangible designs.

6.2.2
RQ2: Structuring Low-Fidelity On-Body Prototyping Sessions
The structured low-fidelity on-body tandem prototyping sessions centered around the Tandem
Design approach significantly enhanced participants’ ability to test and refine their designs
based on real-time feedback iteratively. This hands-on, collaborative process fostered empa-
thy and a deeper understanding of users’ emotional experiences.
By alternating roles between designer and user, participants gained firsthand insights into how
their designs impacted others, leading to more emotionally resonant haptic feedback. Partici-
pant BP2 remarked:
”Through communication, I felt like it was way better that we expressed the first-
person felt experience... we had to give feedback to each other and communicate
really well what we were trying to do.”
This collaborative environment enriched perspectives and improved communication, enabling
designers to receive immediate feedback and make adjustments accordingly.
However, technical limitations hindered the sessions. Hardware constraints, such as limited
actuator types and connectivity issues with the Hapticlabs DevKit, restricted the scope of ex-
ploration and sometimes caused frustration. Software usability issues also impeded the smooth
execution of prototypes.
Additionally, participants identified a need for clearer communication strategies to effectively
convey and interpret emotional feedback. The subjective nature of emotions meant that without
effective dialogue, designers might misinterpret user responses.
To improve future prototyping sessions, it is recommended to incorporate more robust and ver-
satile hardware, such as devices with a greater variety of actuators and reliable connectivity.
Providing training on effective communication techniques, including active listening and artic-
ulating emotional experiences, can enhance collaboration. Structured communication exercises
or guidelines could be integrated into the sessions to support this.
By addressing technical limitations and enhancing communication strategies, future low-fidelity
on-body prototyping sessions can further optimize the benefits of the Tandem Design approach,
leading to more effective and emotionally resonant haptic designs.
6.2.3
RQ3: Challenges Faced by Novice Interaction Designers
Novice interaction designers faced several challenges during the integration of haptic feedback
into low-fidelity prototypes. Technical complexities, such as software glitches and limited hard-
ware capabilities, impeded their ability to create diverse and sophisticated haptic designs. For
example, participant CP1 experienced hardware issues:
”Hardware challenges: Bluetooth connection was very bad and hindered the pro-
cess... we had some issues with the interactions with the program as well.”


============================================================
PAGE 146
============================================================

6
CONCLUSION
133
The limited number of actuators and types available restricted creative possibilities, making it
difficult to prototype complex haptic patterns or spatially distributed feedback. Participant AP1
noted:
”It’s hard to design something when you only have one instance of a type of actua-
tor... the kit didn’t limit us in terms of ideation but implementation.”
The subjective nature of emotional interpretation added another layer of difficulty. Design-
ers grappled with translating personal emotions into haptic patterns that would be universally
understandable and emotionally impactful. As participant AP1 expressed:
”It’s one thing to have this feeling coming from the inside... and then it’s another
thing to provoke it with the external stimulator.”
Individual differences in emotional experiences and perceptions made it challenging to create
designs that resonated with others.
To overcome these obstacles, several mitigation strategies are suggested:
• Technical Enhancements: Providing more intuitive and reliable technical tools can re-
duce technical barriers. This includes hardware with diverse and multiple actuators, sta-
ble connectivity, and beginner-friendly software interfaces with features like predefined
haptic patterns.
• Prior Comprehensive Training: Offering training prior to the main activities that cover
both the technical aspects of haptic design and the nuances of emotional translation can
better prepare novice designers and therefore make better use of the limited time for the
exploratory experience prototyping process. Workshops on haptic technology, emotional
expression, and user experience design can enhance the competence and confidence of
novice interaction designers.
• Emphasis on Communication and Empathy: Encouraging open dialogue, active lis-
tening, and empathy in the design process is crucial. Techniques such as empathic in-
terviewing and collaborative reflection can help designers understand users’ emotional
states more deeply.
• Mentorship and Support: Providing access to experienced mentors or facilitators can
guide novice designers through challenges, offering advice and sharing best practices.
By implementing these strategies, novice interaction designers can be better equipped to nav-
igate technical complexities and the subjective nature of emotional interpretation, leading to
more effective and innovative haptic designs.

RQ4: Accessibility Through the Proposed Modular Toolkit
The study found that making on-body affective haptic prototyping accessible to novice inter-
action designers requires a synergistic combination of user-friendly tools and well-structured
methodologies. In response to this need, this thesis proposes a modular toolkit approach that
integrates both hardware and methodological components specifically designed to lower tech-
nical barriers and enhance the learning experience for novices as described in table 3.
Description of the Modular Toolkit:
The proposed modular toolkit comprises:
No.
Component Description
1.

CONCLUSION
135
Lowering Technical Barriers: The hardware and software components eliminate the need for
coding expertise, allowing novices to focus on creative design aspects. Participant CP2 appre-
ciated this ease of use:
”It was new to me which made it challenging at first. However, the structured and
organized approach used during the workshop made it a guided process.”
Enhancing Creative Exploration: The methodological framework guides participants in artic-
ulating emotions and translating them into haptic feedback, enhancing both the design process
and the communication of ideas. The flexibility to define personal emotional terms encourages
unrestricted creative exploration.
Facilitating Empathy and Collaboration: The Tandem Design approach fosters a collabo-
rative environment where participants gain firsthand insights into user experiences, leading to
more emotionally resonant designs.
Evidence from the Study:
Participants in the workshop effectively utilized the toolkit to create affective haptic prototypes.
Despite some limitations, the toolkit’s combination of user-friendly hardware and supportive
methodologies enabled novices to engage with haptic design in meaningful ways.
However, limitations were observed, and participants suggested improvements:
Hardware Constraints: Limited actuator types and connectivity issues restricted exploration.
Participant BP2 suggested:
”Only having two actuators was difficult because they unfolded their impact only
locally... Material that spreads a sensation over the skin! Or a sequence of actua-
tors... The small local impact is not versatile enough.”
Methodological Constraints: Some participants felt constrained by predefined emotional cat-
egories. Participant AP1 recommended:
”Maybe in the future it makes sense to let people describe their own words, feelings,
and not try to limit those to emotions... So that the exploration part is there.”
Future Improvement Suggestions: To enhance the toolkit’s usefulness and accessibility, fu-
ture efforts should focus on:
Hardware Enhancements: Incorporating more versatile actuators, improving connectivity,
and providing accessories for easier on-body prototyping.
Software Preparation or Introduction: Developing more intuitive interfaces with additional
features like customizable haptic patterns and multi-actuator support and giving a thorough
introduction to the basic functionalities is recommended.
Methodological Refinements: Expanding the methodological framework to include practices
like body-storming and allowing for greater flexibility in emotional expression.

Comprehensive Support Materials: Providing detailed guides, tutorials, and prior introduc-
tion activities to aid novices in using the toolkit effectively before diving into the main activities.
Conclusion:
By proposing and evaluating this new modular toolkit, this section provides a concrete answer
to RQ4: ”What tools and methodologies are needed to make on-body affective haptic proto-
typing accessible to novice interaction designers?”. The workshop outcomes and participants’
feedback demonstrate that a carefully designed combination of user-friendly hardware, intu-
itive software, and supportive methodologies can make on-body affective haptic prototyping
accessible to novice interaction designers. This integrated approach addresses technical lim-
itations, supports creative exploration, and substantially fosters the prototyping stage for the
development of affective haptic feedback systems.
6.3
Implications for Future Research and Practice
The findings from this study have several implications for future research and practice in affec-
tive haptic design and HCI:
6.3.1
Enhancing Educational Tools and Resources
Integrating structured emotional frameworks and practical methodologies into interaction de-
sign education can aid novice interaction designers in their affective haptic prototyping pro-
cesses. As participant AP1 suggested, providing more vague and broader emotional vocabular-
ies can encourage greater creativity and personal expression.
The use of the toolkit could enhance the learning process for novice interaction designers by
providing structured methods for prototyping, aligning with Spinuzzi’s (2005) principles of
participatory design and Buchenau’s approach of Experience Prototyping [11, 51]. By fur-
ther expanding and incorporating methods like Moussette’s (2012) ”sketching in hardware,” the
toolkit could lower learning barriers, making haptic prototyping more accessible and engaging
for those without a deep technical [38] or psychology background.
6.3.2
Improving Haptic Prototyping Toolkits
Developing more versatile and beginner-friendly haptic prototyping toolkits and frameworks is
essential. This includes incorporating a wider variety of actuators capable of producing diverse
sensations (e.g., pressure, temperature, texture), improving software interfaces to be more intu-
itive and supportive of creative exploration, and offering accessible methodologies to bridge the
psychological component of emotional design with the technical development of prototypes.
Improving the control software interfaces of the haptic hardware kits to be more intuitive and
supportive of creative exploration is equally important. Simplifying the interaction with soft-
ware and including pre-designed haptic feedback patterns and interactive tutorials could lower
the entry barrier for novice interaction designers. This enhancement would allow designers to

============================================================

6
CONCLUSION
137
focus more on the creative aspects of haptic design without being hindered by technical com-
plexities.
6.3.3
Emphasizing Collaborative and User-Centered Design Approaches
Encouraging collaborative methodologies like the Tandem Design approach can enhance empa-
thy and communication in the prototyping design process, leading to more effective and emo-
tionally resonant haptic feedback systems. This approach fosters a deeper understanding of
users’ emotional experiences and supports iterative refinement based on real-time feedback,
facilitating greater empathy and iterative refinement of designs.
6.3.4
Expanding Research Contexts and Participant Diversity
Future research should involve a larger and more diverse participant pool to capture a broader
range of experiences and perspectives. Involving participants from different cultural back-
grounds, age groups, and levels of design experience would enhance the validity and appli-
cability of the results, ensuring that the toolkit and methodologies are applicable to a broader
audience.
Testing the components of the modular toolkit in various application domains, such as mental
health therapy, entertainment technology, and social communication, can provide deeper in-
sights into its effectiveness, usefulness, and versatility. This broader application could reveal
unique challenges and opportunities specific to different contexts.
6.3.5
Conducting Longitudinal Studies
Longitudinal studies would allow for the assessment of the sustained impact of the individual
components of the modular toolkit (e.g., hardware, software, methodologies) on participants’
skills and their ability to engage in affective haptic design over time. This could inform the
development of more effective educational programs and resources. By tracking participants’
progress over extended periods, researchers can gain insights into how proficiency and confi-
dence in affective haptic design develop and how sustained use of the toolkit influences design
practices.
6.3.6
Improving Workshop Structure and Communication Strategies
Feedback indicated that aspects of the workshop structure could be improved to enhance par-
ticipant engagement and learning outcomes. AP1 mentioned feeling confused due to skipped
activities and redundant information.
Addressing these issues by providing clearer instructions, better pacing, and ensuring that all
activities are meaningfully integrated could improve the overall effectiveness of the workshop.


============================================================
PAGE 151
============================================================

6
CONCLUSION
138
Future workshops should strive for a balance between structured guidance and flexible explo-
ration to support learning and creativity.
Additionally, participants identified a need for clearer communication strategies to effectively
convey and interpret emotional feedback. The subjective nature of emotions means that without
effective dialogue, designers might misinterpret user responses. Providing training on effective
communication techniques, including active listening and articulating emotional experiences,
can enhance collaboration and reduce misunderstandings.
6.4
Limitations of the Study
Several limitations must be acknowledged:
• Sample Size and Diversity: The small and relatively homogeneous participant sample
limits the generalizability of the findings. All participants were advanced students in HCI-
related fields, which may have influenced their engagement with and comprehension of
the proposed methodologies and tools used in this workshop.
• Technical Constraints: Hardware limitations, such as the limited number and type of
actuators, impacted participants’ ability to fully explore and implement their haptic design
ideas. Software usability issues also hindered the design process for some participants.
• Workshop Structure: Some participants found parts of the workshop confusing or rushed,
indicating a need for prior familiarization sessions with the hardware and software used
in the workshop, considerate time planning for the included activities of the workshop,
clearer instructions and better pacing during the execution of it.
These limitations suggest that the findings may not fully represent the challenges faced by
a broader or more diverse group of novice interaction designers in learning the principles of
affective haptic feedback design. Regardless, the limited number of participants is only suf-
ficient to explore Europe’s cultural differences and needs further exploration in future studies
to investigate cultures that have stronger differences in perception of affective touch or haptic
technologies.
6.5
Ethical Considerations
Given the deeply personal nature of affective haptic design, ethical considerations were paramount
in this study. Participants engaged with intimate emotional experiences, necessitating careful
handling to ensure their well-being. This thesis adhered to ethical guidelines by obtaining in-
formed consent, ensuring participants were fully aware of the study’s objectives and their right
to withdraw at any time. During discussions of personal emotions, it was made sure to not over-
whelm or force any participant to share and notice attentive to signs of discomfort, and provide
support or time as needed. Additionally, this study avoided eliciting negative emotions that

could cause distress, aligning with the American Psychological Association’s (2017) Ethical
Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct 10.
6.6
Final Remarks
A modular methodological toolkit was created to support novice interaction designers in cre-
ating AHFS. By combining theoretical frameworks with practical methodologies, collaborative
approaches, and the creation of a workshop structure and methodological templates specified
for single-modal affective haptic design with a no-coding haptic hardware toolkit, this thesis
addresses key challenges in teaching and researching affective haptic prototyping.
While technical limitations and the subjective nature of emotions present ongoing challenges,
the positive reception of the toolkit and methodologies indicates a promising direction for future
development. As BP1 suitably concluded:
”Connecting emotions through the objects creates a very important baseline and
conceptual understanding for the haptic design.”
This thesis addresses key challenges in teaching and researching affective haptic prototyping
by combining theoretical human-centered methodologies and a version of a commercial non-
coding haptic prototyping kit. It further emphasizes the importance of emotional resonance and
human-centered design in technological innovation regarding the imitation and utilization of
human touch properties, i.e. vibrotactile haptic feedback, and the impactful reactions that can
be triggered within the users of these affective haptic systems. Refining the toolkit and enhanc-
ing educational resources will empower new interaction designers to engage deeply with the
emotional aspects of haptic human-computer interaction through collaborative, user-centered
practices.
The insights gained from this study provide a foundation for future work aimed at develop-
ing more sophisticated, user-centered, and emotionally personalized affective haptic interaction
prototypes. By managing the pinpointed challenges and incorporating the suggested workshop
refinements, future iterations of the toolkit and workshop structure can further advance the field,
ultimately enhancing the research and prototyping processes of how we interact with technology
on an emotional level and therefore empowering novice interaction designers to create AHFS
that genuinely connect with target users on a profound personal emotional level. This ensures
that this delicate third-wave HCI topic steers the development and research of Affective Haptics
in a positive, empowering, and ethically considerate direction.

The workshop utilized a Miro board as a central tool for guiding participants through the various
stages of the workshop, including the body mapping, metaphor elicitation, and prototyping
phases. The board provided a shared digital space for all participants to collaborate and reflect
on their design processes.
To allow for replication or adaptation of the workshop structure, a template of the Miro board
used during the workshop can be accessed via the following link:

Informed Consent - Workshop
In this appendix section, the informed consent document used for the Affective Haptic On-
Body Tandem Workshop is presented (Figure 57). The document ensures participants are fully
informed about the workshop’s purpose, procedures, data collection methods, and their rights
as participants, including confidentiality and the option to withdraw at any time.
This form was handed out to the participants before the conduction of the workshop. This
ensured they were informed about the workshop procedures, had the time to gather information
about haptic design, and freely decide whether they wanted to participate.

Glossary of Terminologies
Haptic Feedback: The use of tactile sensations (e.g., vibrations, forces) to simulate touch ex-
periences or convey information through a user interface, commonly applied in devices
like smartphones and wearables.
Circumplex Model of Affect: A framework for categorizing emotions across two dimensions:
valence (positive-negative) and arousal (low-high). It is used to map and understand
emotional experiences in affective computing and design.
Valence: In the Circumplex Model of Affect, valence refers to the emotional dimension rang-
ing from negative (unpleasant) to positive (pleasant) feelings, indicating the positivity or
negativity of an emotional experience.
Arousal: In the Circumplex Model of Affect, arousal denotes the intensity of emotional or
physiological activation, ranging from low (calm, relaxed) to high (excited, alert).

FH Salzburg Campus Urstein SE 357
Workshop Overview
Welcome to the Affective Haptic On-Body tandem Workshop!
This workshop is designed to introduce you to the basics of haptic technology and guide you
through creating and prototyping emotionally affective haptic systems. Within 4 hours, you
will work in pairs to explore the potential of haptic feedback in enhancing user experience
through emotionally resonant designs.
Please bring an object that evokes a specific emotion you feel comfortable sharing in a
group activity to help us understand embodied metaphor elicitation.
Purpose of the Study
This FH-Salzburg master thesis workshop is designed to explore the design process of
low-fidelity (LoFi) affective haptic on-body prototyping. This study aims to understand
the usefulness of embodied metaphors, body maps, and a haptic hardware toolkit in
helping novice haptic designers create emotionally resonant haptic feedback systems.
The workshop will investigate the following research questions:
1.
What is the impact of using embodied metaphors and body maps on the design and
communication process of haptic feedback for novice haptic designers?
2.
How can low-fidelity on-body tandem prototyping sessions with haptic feedback be
structured to elicit valuable insights into emotional responses from users?
3.
What specific challenges do novice haptic designers encounter when integrating
haptic feedback into low-fidelity on-body prototype design concepts?
4.
How can the use of a haptic hardware toolkit make on-body affective haptic
prototyping accessible to novice haptic designers?

Body Mapping: A technique used in soma-based design to visually represent how individuals
experience emotions in different parts of the body. This informs the design of affective
systems and haptic feedback mechanisms.
Embodied Metaphor Elicitation: A design approach that translates abstract emotional con-
cepts into physical and tangible design elements by using metaphors grounded in bodily
experiences.
Experience Prototyping: A prototyping method focused on evaluating and iterating on user
experiences. It emphasizes immersing designers and users in interactive prototypes to
understand experiential aspects.
Lo-Fi Prototyping: The creation of low-fidelity, simplified prototypes that capture basic de-
sign ideas. Lo-fi prototyping is often used in early design stages for quick iteration and
feedback gathering.
Tandem Design: A collaborative design process in which two participants alternate between
the roles of designer and user. This iterative approach helps refine the design by continu-
ously incorporating feedback from both perspectives.
Hapticlabs DevKit: A toolkit designed for creating and testing haptic feedback. It includes
various haptic actuators and a user-friendly interface that enables the design of haptic
patterns without requiring programming skills.
ERM (Eccentric Rotating Mass) Actuators: A type of actuator that produces vibration by
spinning an unbalanced mass. Common in mobile devices, it is used for basic vibration
feedback such as alerts or notifications.
LRA (Linear Resonant Actuator) Actuators: Actuators that generate vibrations through lin-
ear oscillations. These actuators are known for delivering precise and efficient haptic
feedback with fast response times and low energy consumption.
Piezoelectric Actuators: Actuators that leverage piezoelectric materials to create precise, rapid
vibrations when subjected to an electric current. These are commonly used in high-
fidelity haptic systems requiring fine control.

Additional Tools Used
For preliminary research, I used the PDF scan and summary functionality of ChatGPT11 to sort
the papers into relevant clusters and compare the results on a MIRO board12 with my notes and
the feedback given by my supervisor. The selected, relevant paper categories were then refined
manually and assessed for their correlations and contribution to the thesis after a personal full
read. As for my writing, I wrote the content of this thesis myself and refined it by integrating

grammatical feedback suggestions from Quillbot13 and Grammarly14 to make sure my writing
style was concise, straightforward, correctly spelled, and in active voicing. After finishing my
writing phase, instead of using ChatGPT’s capabilities to help me verify my data citations and
completeness of my thesis, I utilized a local Large Language Model (LLM) of Metas ”LLama-
4”15 in the open-source GitHub project ”LocalGPT”16 to get structural feedback on my thesis
writing. Based on the feedback, I simplified my table of contents for the sake of readability,
clarity, and logical narrative of argumentations, wrote up suggested transitional paragraphs be-
tween the sections, and corrected grammatical and careless errors in my thesis draft. The choice
of using a local LLM was made to get continuous feedback on my drafts, and, for the included
participant data, it was crucial to maintain a high level of data protection of the participant’s sen-
sitive qualitative data presented in the thesis when accessing the logical argumentation structure
of my discussion and conclusion sections in correlation to the qualitative user data.
To preserve anonymity and discretion in photographing the workshop and participants during
their design processes, the image web tool ”Picdefacer”https://picdefacer.com/en/
was used to pixelate participants’ faces.
The LaTeX markup language platform Overleaf 17 was used to write this thesis, and templates
from the official Overleaf documentation 18 were utilized to include figures and tables in a
correct and structured manner.

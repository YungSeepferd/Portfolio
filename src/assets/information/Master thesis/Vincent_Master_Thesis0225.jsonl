{"doc_id": "Vincent_Master_Thesis0225.pdf", "page": 3, "text": "Abstract\nThis thesis proposes the development and evaluation of a modular methodological toolkit de-\nsigned to assist novice haptic designers in creating affective haptic feedback systems that can\nchange a user’s emotional state through the properties of human touch. Addressing the technical\ncomplexities and lack of accessible resources in affective haptic prototyping, the toolkit inte-\ngrates theoretical frameworks such as the Circumplex Model of Affect (Russell, 1980; Posner et\nal., 2005) [43, 45], Emotion Typology from TU Delft [20], embodied metaphors (Bakker, 2012;\nNardon and Hari, 2021) [5, 39], body mapping (Turmo Vidal et al., 2023; Cochrane et al. 2021,\nNummenmaa et al., 2014) [15, 41, 56], and experience prototyping (Buchenau and Suri, 2000;\nMoussette, 2012) [11, 38]. This integration helps novice designers translate complex emotional\nconcepts into tangible haptic prototypes, guided by principles from emotional design (Norman,\n2004; Walter, 2011) [40, 59]. These frameworks simplify the translation of abstract emotional\nconcepts into tangible haptic experiences, making the prototyping process more approachable\nfor those without extensive technical backgrounds.\nAn educational workshop was conducted with six participants from diverse backgrounds in\nhuman-computer interaction and related fields of interaction design. The workshop included ed-\nucative lecture elements and prototyping activities such as low-fidelity on-body prototyping in\ntandem team sessions, where participants alternated roles between designer and user. Through-\nout this workshop, participants engaged in iterative design processes, utilizing the toolkit to map\nemotional states to haptic stimuli and creating prototyping concepts for personalized affective\nhaptic experiences. The chosen emotion was based on an object that the participants brought to\nthe workshop with which they had a personal emotional connection when interacting with it.\nThe findings indicate that the toolkit enhanced participants’ understanding of affective haptic\ndesign and prototyping. The use of embodied metaphors and body maps facilitated the com-\nmunication and translation of complex emotions into haptic feedback, improving perceived\ncollaboration and design outcomes. Participants reported that the toolkit reduced technical bar-\nriers, allowing them to focus on human-centered design aspects. However, challenges were\nidentified, including technical limitations of the haptic hardware, a need for more diverse mate-\nrials, and the subjectivity of emotional interpretation in the context of single-modal haptic user\nexperiences.\nThis research contributes to the exploration and democratization of affective haptic technology\nby proposing accessible methodologies that empower novice interaction designers. The toolkit\nfosters emotional engagement and user-centered design practices, potentially influencing future\ndevelopments in HCI, wearable technology, and affective computing. Recommendations for\nfuture work include expanding the toolkit to include a wider variety of haptic modalities, ad-\njusting the adequate integration and preparation of the software of no-coding haptic hardware\nkits used, and conducting studies with more diverse participant groups to assess the toolkit’s\napplicability across various contexts and cultures.\nKeywords: Affective Haptics, Interaction Design, Prototyping, Methodological Toolkit, Edu-\ncational Workshop\nii"}

This evolution illustrates\nthe importance of comprehending how methodologies have changed and why it is becoming\nimportant to make accessible research tools for the emerging research fields of Affective Haptics\n[18, 37, 47, 57].\nThe need for accessible and intuitive design methodologies for novice interaction designers in\naffective haptic design is highlighted by recent literature, including the affective haptic literature\nreview by Vyas et al. (2023) [57], the overview of the history of haptic hardware systems\nby Seifi et al. (2019) [47], and an overview of recent advancements in the emerging field of\naffective haptic design provided Eid and Osman (2016) [18]. These resources underscore the\nimportance of creating easy-to-understand, context-appropriate methodologies for ethical and\neffective affective haptic design.To foster responsible and effective AHSD, novice interaction\ndesigners and researchers need easy-to-understand, context-appropriate methodologies. These\nmethodologies will ensure that affective haptic systems are ethically designed and reactive to\nusers’ emotional needs.\nThis thesis proposes the concept of a modular methodological toolkit for novice interaction de-\nsigners, drawing on principles such as Haptipedia’s design framework [47], exemplary toolkits\nlike Haptic Bits Lab’s low-cost haptic prototyping tools1, and Moussette’s ‘Simple Haptics’\ndesign philosophy [37]. Thereby this research addresses the problem of inaccessible affective\nhaptic design tools by proposing an approach to simplify emotional design and prototyping\nprocesses while maintaining flexibility for individual user contexts. The modular methodologi-\ncal toolkit of this thesis draws on these principles to adjust to the fact that single-modal haptic\nexperiences are highly personal and context-dependent. The toolkit will provide novice interac-\ntion designers with a structured approach to acquiring and employing methodologies applicable\nto single-modal affective haptic design, including body maps, embodied metaphor elicitation,\nEmotion Typology, the complex model of affect, and Experience Prototyping principles. The\napplication of these methodologies will be taught through a workshop and will also apply to\nthe design processes of multi-modal systems that include affective haptic feedback. The toolkit\nwill help them deal with technical challenges and use these methodologies to teach how to de-\nsign affective haptic feedback or create affective haptic design systems that can be tested for\nemotional impact.\nThe following sections introduce the historical context of HCI’s development, explore the rele-\nvance of Affective Haptics, and outline the need for accessible methodologies for novice inter-\naction designers.\n1https://lowingki.com/meet-the-haptic-bits-lab/"}
{"doc_id": "Vincent_Master_Thesis0225.pdf", "page": 16, "text": "1\nINTRODUCTION\n3\n1.1.1\nFirst Wave: Cognitive Science, Usability and Efficiency\nCognitive science and human factors engineering significantly created the first wave of HCI,\nwhich took place from the 1980s to the early 1990s. The primary focus during this period\nwas optimizing the usability and efficiency of technological systems in controlled environ-\nments. Researchers applied meticulous scientific methods to study how users interacted with\ncommand-line interfaces and early graphical user interfaces (GUIs) [8, 9]. These efforts estab-\nlished foundational principles for beginner-friendly system design, prioritizing ease of learning,\ntask efficiency, and error minimization [8, 12].\nWhile the first wave improved usability, it was criticized for being too rigid and task-focused,\nneglecting the broader social contexts in which interactions occurred. As computers were intro-\nduced to everyday work life, there was a growing recognition that the usability of technological\nsystems needed to extend beyond controlled, task-based environments and account for more\ndynamic social contexts. While the focus of the first wave was primarily on improving usability\nthrough controlled, cognitive studies, it became increasingly clear that more complex environ-\nments and social interactions required new research methodologies and technologies to become\njust to the broadened user group with new application contexts [8].\n1.1.2\nSecond Wave: Context and Social Interaction\nFrom 1992 to 2006, the second wave of HCI shifted its focus towards context and social inter-\naction. During this period, technology spread into workplaces, homes, and communities, and\nresearchers began investigating how systems could support collaborative work and group inter-\naction. Technologies such as email systems and groupware emerged to support multiple users\nworking together in shared environments, requiring new methodologies to enhance them with a\nscientific basis [6, 8, 9].\n• Situated Action (Lucy Suchman, 1987) emphasizes that human actions are context-\ndependent and cannot be reliably predicted in isolation. Rather than following predeter-\nmined plans, human behavior evolves through dynamic interactions with the environment,\nsuggesting that technology should accommodate this fluidity [29].\n• Distributed Cognition (Ed Hutchins) extends the concept of cognition beyond the indi-\nvidual to include interactions with other people and objects in their environment, propos-\ning that information is distributed across people, objects, and tools within an environment.\nThis theory highlights the importance of designing systems that support collaborative\nwork environments with shared knowledge [7, 25].\n• Activity Theory (Vygotsky and Engestr¨om) focuses on understanding human activities\nwithin social and cultural contexts. It argues that individuals use tools to achieve goals,\nwhich are shaped by the community they belong to. This framework emphasizes the\nimportance of designing technology that aligns with users’ practices and objectives [7, 9,\n19, 58]."}
{"doc_id": "Vincent_Master_Thesis0225.pdf", "page": 17, "text": "1\nINTRODUCTION\n4\nThese frameworks helped expand HCI’s focus from individual tasks to social systems, encour-\naging the design of more adaptive technologies that support complex human interactions. This\nwave also introduced Participatory Design, Co-design, Contextual Inquiry, and Experience Pro-\ntotyping methodologies, which involve users directly in the design process, ensuring that the\nresulting systems fit within their real-world needs and practices [8, 9, 11, 44, 50]. Buchenau\nand Suri’s (2000) concept of Experience Prototyping builds on this idea by allowing designers\nand users to engage directly with prototypes during the early prototyping process stage, enabling\na more immersive exploration of how a design might feel in practice [11]. This methodolog-\nical approach for the prototyping phase serves as a fundamental basis for this thesis research.\nThe thesis contribution is in the form of an interactive affective haptic workshop structure con-\ncentrating on enhancing the prototyping process of affective haptics for novice interaction de-\nsigners. As introduced by Raven and Flanders (1996), contextual inquiry provided a method\nfor understanding how users engage with technology in their natural environments, uncovering\ninsights into behavior and usage patterns that controlled studies could not reveal [44].\nHowever, while participatory design was influential in structured work environments to consider\nwork-related contexts, the second wave often struggled to accommodate the more spontaneous\nand personal uses of technology that emerged with the advent of mobile and ubiquitous com-\nputing [8, 13]. This limitation paved the way for the third wave, where individualization and\nemotional engagement became central. As Bødker (2015) argues, the third wave of HCI fo-\ncuses on experience and meaning-making, but traditional methods often fall short when applied\nto non-work contexts and emergent technologies like Affective Haptics [8].\n1.1.3\nThird Wave: Individualization, Experience, and Emotionally Affective Technolo-\ngies\nThe third wave of HCI, which emerged in the early 2000s, is characterized by a shift towards\nexperiential and emotional dimensions of interaction (Bødker, 2006, 2015) [8, 9]. This shift\nhas fostered the rise of Affective Computing and haptics, focusing on how technologies can be\nembedded in everyday personal contexts to enhance emotional engagement. It moves beyond\nfunctionality and usability to consider technology as profoundly intertwined with users’ per-\nsonal, social, and cultural identities [19]. These experiential, emotional, and aesthetic aspects\nof HCI consider how technology can support emotional well-being, personal expression, and\nsocial engagement in recognition that technology is more than just a tool for the workplace but\nalso a medium that shapes and influences the human experience profoundly on an every-day\nbasis [8, 21].\nThe third wave emphasizes individualism and personalization, recognizing that users have\nunique needs and emotional responses. This shift has led to the rise of Affective Comput-\ning—designing systems that recognize and respond to users’ emotions, thereby fostering per-\nsonalized user experiences that connect on a deeper emotional level. Affective Computing is the\npractice of developing systems that can recognize, interpret, and respond to users’ emotional\nstates. This approach goes beyond the usability focus of earlier technologies, prioritizing how\ntechnology can support personal well-being and emotional engagement. It also includes the re-\nsearch and development of Affective Haptics, which explores how tactile feedback can convey"}

Affective Haptics open up new possibilities\nfor enhanced interaction in virtual and remote physical spaces, making use of the limited visual\nspace available. Current haptic interfaces are mainly designed for desks and are unable to fully\nsupport widespread affective haptic communication. [18].\nIn the aforementioned context of healthcare, Affective Haptics can play a critical role, lever-\naging the sense of touch to convey emotional information. As technologies like virtual reality,\nwearable devices, and immersive interfaces become more prevalent [23, 24], haptics can of-\nfer an opportunity to engage users on a deeper emotional level through tactile feedback that\nresonates with their personal UXs, which shape their perceptual reality. The third wave’s focus\non embodied interaction and emotional engagement makes haptics an essential area of research,\nparticularly in the context of Affective Computing. Still, it has yet to be explored and researched\nbefore it can be deployed within everyday technology with effective, personalized intent.\nIn this context, Affective Haptics emerged as a critical modality for enhancing emotional en-\ngagement. As wearable technologies, virtual reality (VR), and immersive interfaces became\nmore prevalent, the potential for haptics to influence emotional states became clear, offering\nusers a more personalized, immersive experience [18]. Wearable devices, in particular, are cen-\ntral to this development. Gonz´alez Ram´ırez et al. (2023) and Hickey et al. (2021) illustrate how\nwearable technologies, through biofeedback systems, are becoming essential tools for moni-\ntoring stress and emotional well-being, incorporating haptic feedback to regulate physiological\nand emotional responses in real-time [23, 24].\nBødker (2015) elaborates on the challenges and opportunities presented by the third wave,\nmainly focusing on “rest-of-life technologies” and the expansion of HCI beyond the workplace\ninto every aspect of daily life. The third wave also brought about new methodological chal-\nlenges, as traditional participatory design approaches were questioned for their applicability\nto emergent, non-work contexts. Bødker argues for a balance between the individual experi-\nence emphasized by the third wave and the shared, collaborative practices rooted in the second\nwave, proposing that HCI must embrace both to address the complexities of modern and future\ntechnology use [8].\nTo conclude the theoretical context, HCI has evolved significantly from its early focus on op-\ntimizing user efficiency through cognitive modeling and ergonomics to embracing emotional,\nsocial, and experiential dimensions in recent years. The third wave of HCI highlights the role\nof personalization and emotion, positioning Affective Haptics, among other things at the fore-\nfront of creating meaningful, emotionally affective UXs of the future. This shift also fostered\nthe rise of Affective Computing, which designs systems capable of recognizing and responding\nto users’ emotional states, with haptic feedback offering a potential role in facilitating tailored\naffective experiences.\nAffective Computing As explored by Tian et al. (2022), Affective Computing is applied across\nvarious domains, from mental health and education to entertainment and human-robot interac-\ntion. The core idea is to enable computers and devices to process emotional data in a way that\nsupports more personalized, adaptive, and human-like interactions. This capability enhances"}

It opens up new possibilities\nfor designing real-time affective technological systems that can influence and support users’\nemotional well-being in impactful and meaningful ways [54].\n1.2\nThe Role of Haptic Feedback\nHaptics refers to the technology that simulates touch and allows users to experience tactile feed-\nback through vibrations, pressure, or motion. It is divided into two main types: tactile feedback\nand kinesthetic feedback. Tactile feedback involves sensations felt on the skin, such as vibra-\ntions, temperature, and texture, while kinesthetic feedback provides information about move-\nment and the forces felt through muscles and joints, offering a sense of weight and resistance\n[57]. These systems combine to create multi-dimensional interactions that can enhance user\nengagement. MacLean (2022) explores the role of haptics in promoting emotional regulation,\nparticularly in wellness applications, where personalized haptic stimuli can help users manage\nstress and anxiety [34]. As haptic technology evolves, it is increasingly becoming a critical tool\nfor designing affective interactions across wearables, VR, and immersive environments.\nAffective Haptics refers to using tactile feedback to evoke or communicate emotions. The sense\nof touch is deeply connected to human emotions, making it a powerful tool for creating more\nimmersive and emotionally engaging UX. Studies have shown that haptic feedback can convey\na wide range of emotions, from comfort and relaxation to urgency and stress [14, 18, 28, 55].\nThe Circumplex Model of Affect (Russell, 1980) stems from cognitive sciences and describes\nemotions based on two variables on a two-dimensional diagram. This is used in affective haptic\nresearch and development to reduce the complexity of emotions on a 2D matrix [45]. Posner\nlater argues that emotions are not singular but fluent and multiple emotions can be felt at the\nsame time [43]. This theory provides a useful framework for haptic designers to map emotions\nand translate them into haptic feedback corresponding to specific emotional states. This model\norganizes emotions based on valence (pleasure-displeasure categorization of the emotion) on\nthe X-axis and arousal (activation-deactivation level of the emotion described) on the Y-axis\nand designers can design tactile stimuli with a corresponding emotional response more easily.\nBy mapping haptic stimuli to this model, designers can categorize haptic stimuli into emotional\nrepresentations and, thus, could create tactile feedback that can evoke emotions like calmness,\nexcitement, or anxiety [28, 43, 45].\nRecent developments in haptic technology research, such as those looked at by Swindells et\nal. (2014), allow for guidelines and exploration of rapid prototyping and experimentation with\nvibrotactile effects, facilitating the creation of emotionally engaging feedback systems [52].\nDespite its potential, designing affective haptic feedback presents unique challenges, particu-\nlarly for novice interaction designers who may not have experience with the technical and emo-\ntional nuances of haptic technology, human touch perception, and their correlated emotional\nresponse. Haptics encompass an interdisciplinary approach involving biomechanics, psychol-\nogy, neurophysiology, engineering, and computer science, focusing on the exploration of human\ntouch and force feedback within the context of contemporary HCI [18].

This is further complicated by the lack of accessible, beginner-friendly hardware\ntoolkits and accessible methodological resources and guidelines that could facilitate these com-\nplex thought and design processes.\nThe complexity of current haptic toolkits - whether it be hardware, software or methodological\ntoolkits -, which frequently require technical mastery over emotional design thinking, results in\na lack of accessible resources for novice interaction designers (Vyas et al., 2023) [57]. Spinuzzi\n(2005) emphasizes the importance of participatory methods, suggesting that novice designers\nbenefit from practical, user-centered tools that bridge advanced technology with accessible de-\nsign approaches [51]. This toolkit aims to provide such a bridge, simplifying the prototyping of\nsubjective single-modal affective haptic feedback through embodied design principles to teach\naffective haptic design to novice interaction designers.\nWhile there are several toolkits for haptic design, many are geared toward haptic engineering,\nor computer science experts, and focus mainly on technical aspects such as actuator control and\nsignal processing. novice interaction designers, especially those without a deep understanding\nof haptics, coding, or engineering principles, often struggle to translate abstract emotional con-\ncepts into concrete single-modal affective haptic feedback for user testing. In addition, existing\nresources usually lack support for iterative testing and emotional guidance, which are crucial\nfor developing affective haptic feedback systems(AHFS) that achieve the intended emotional\nimpact. To address this issue, the proposed toolkit will provide simplified methodological re-\nsources to guide designers through their design processes. It will offer materials to support\nideation, prototyping, and user testing, integrating technical and emotional considerations ef-\nfectively.\nRecent innovations like the Haptic Bits Lab have demonstrated how accessible, low-cost haptic\nprototyping tools can enable rapid experimentation in haptic feedback design. By offering an\nintuitive and modular approach, projects such as these support novice interaction designers in\nexploring the possibilities of haptic technology without a requirement for extensive technical\nexpertise2\nTo support novice interaction designers in creating single-modal(i.e. only haptic stimulus as\ninteraction) affective haptic systems, concepts from Soma Design, embodied metaphor elici-\n2https://lowingki.com/meet-the-haptic-bits-lab/"}

Drawing on methodologies such as Soma Design [15, 56], embodied\nmetaphor elicitation [5], and the Circumplex Model of Affect [43, 45], this toolkit simplifies the\nemotional design process by providing a novel approach for combining the theoretical frame-\nworks. The Emotion Typology from TU Delft further aids in breaking down complex emotional\nstates into their core components of valence and arousal, helping designers align their haptic\ndesigns with intended emotional responses [20]. By using these frameworks, novice interac-\ntion designers can develop a structured approach to translating abstract emotions into concrete,\ntestable haptic feedback.\n1.4\nResearch Questions and Hypothesis\nThe primary purpose of this thesis is to develop and test a comprehensive methodological toolkit\ndesigned to support novice interaction designers in creating affective haptic feedback. The\ntoolkit leverages existing design methodologies including embodied metaphor elicitation, the\nCircumplex Model of Affect, and Experience Prototyping to provide novice designers with\nstructured, accessible approaches to creating affective haptic systems. The methods in this\ntoolkit were chosen to make single-modal affective haptic design more accessible by creating\nand combining beginner-friendly resources, guidelines, and methodologies that guide designers\nthrough their design process to integrate suitable approaches to affective haptic feedback into\ntheir projects. The core of the toolkit builds upon existing frameworks and tools, including the\nCircumplex Model of Affect (Russell, 1980) [45], embodied metaphors (Bakker et al., 2012)\n[5], body mapping (Turmo Vidal et al., 2023) [56], and Experience Prototyping (Buchenau and\nSuri, 2000) [11], adapting them to suit novice designers’ needs.

The interpretation of a stim-\nulus is highly dependent on context, and the interpretation can vary significantly based on the\nsocial, cultural, and environmental factors surrounding the interaction [18, 36]. This is espe-\ncially true for haptic stimuli, as the meaning of touch has vastly different meanings depending\non our cultural upbringing.

At present, there is no effective Affective Haptics repository available.\nThe design of an effective Affective Haptics system relies on successful emotion induction.\nTo address this, research and design of AHFS must be made accessible and a novel Affec-\ntive Haptics database must be created to increase the availability of predictable haptic emotion\nstimuli. This database would store carefully chosen haptic patterns that elicit and/or display\ndifferent emotions and can inform design decisions for future projects in affective haptic feed-\nback design. Essentially, a database for successful emotion induction in Affective Haptics is\nstill undiscovered [18].\nBy addressing these dimensions, the study contributes to the advancement of HCI by fostering\nmore empathetic, user-centered affective haptic design practices. By enhancing the learning\nprocess of novice interaction designers to create single-modal emotionally affective haptic in-\nteractions, respecting the revised version of Engestr¨om’s ”Learning by expanding(2015)” [19],\nthe methodological approaches of the proposed modular toolkit also have the potential to im-\nprove the overall quality of haptic UXs across various applications, from wearable devices to\nimmersive virtual environments.\nTo summarize, HCI branched from cognitive usability studies among other things into more ex-\nperiential and emotion-centered designs. This transformation reflects the growing recognition\nthat technology supports functional tasks and shapes emotional and social experiences. As the\nthird wave of HCI emphasizes emotional engagement and personalization, Affective Haptics —\nusing tactile feedback to evoke and communicate emotions — has emerged as a critical research\narea. However, despite its potential, affective haptic design is still a complex and novel field\nand remains inaccessible to many novice interaction designers due to its technical complexity\nand the lack of beginner-friendly methodological frameworks. To address this gap, this thesis\nproposes a modular toolkit that simplifies the design of affective haptic systems, drawing on key\ntheories and tools from HCI’s evolution. The goal is to make affective haptic design more acces-\nsible, particularly by offering beginner-friendly methods for prototyping, iteration, and testing\nwhich can be expanded into the realm of multi-modal feedback after learning the principles\nfor single-modal haptic stimuli. By leveraging tools like emotion typologies, the Circumplex\nModel of Affect, body map sheets, embodied metaphor elicitation sheets, and no-coding haptic\nprototyping kits (i.e., Hapticlabs DevKit & Studio Software3), this thesis proposes a variety\nof methodological approaches with which designers will be equipped to explore affective hap-\ntic technologies without requiring deep technical expertise. By addressing current research\ngaps and providing accessible methodologies, this work contributes to the ongoing evolution\nof HCI, laying the groundwork for future innovations in affective haptic wearable technologies\nand beyond.

Norman\nposits that successful products must appeal not only on a functional level but also engage users\non visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels. He introduces the concept of emotional design,\nemphasizing that designers should consider the emotional responses their products evoke in\nusers. This perspective is crucial in the context of affective haptic design, where the objective\nof the product device is to elicit specific emotional reactions in a user through tactile feedback.\nResearchers and developers of affective haptic design should therefore be very considerate of\nthe ethical impact they have on the user’s emotional state they design for.\nNorman’s framework categorizes emotional responses into three levels:\n• Visceral Level: Relates to the initial impact of a design, its appearance, feel, and sound.\n• Behavioral Level: Concerns the usability and function of the product.\n• Reflective Level: Involves the user’s personal satisfaction, memories, and the meanings\nattached to the product.\nBy understanding these levels, designers can create products that not only meet functional re-\nquirements but also resonate emotionally with users. In affective haptic design, this means\ndeveloping tactile feedback that can induce emotional experiences aligned with the user’s needs\nand contexts.\nNorman’s emphasis on user-centered design aligns with the goals of our proposed methodolog-\nical toolkit. By integrating emotional considerations into the design process, novice designers\ncan create more engaging and meaningful haptic interactions. This approach supports the need\nfor tools and methodologies that facilitate the articulation, translation, and prototyping of emo-\ntional experiences, which are central to AHFS.\nFurthermore, Norman’s work highlights the subjective nature of emotional responses, reinforc-\ning the importance of iterative design and user feedback."}

(2023), who examined more than 110 papers from significant venues in HCI, Affec-\ntive Computing, and haptics research, stated affective haptic system design(AHSD) has rapidly\nevolved over the past ten years. This analysis highlights not only the growing interdisciplinary\nnature of AHSD but also key advancements in understanding the relationship between touch and\nemotion, focusing on areas such as emotion regulation, body awareness, and bio-sensing [57].\nWhile this literature overview highlights the potential of Affective Haptics, novice interaction\ndesigners still lack accessible tools that bridge the gap between these theoretical advancements\nand practical implementation. According to Vyas et al. (2023) and Eid and Al Osman (2016)\n[18], Affective Haptics will become a critical component of HCI by not only eliciting emo-\ntions but also enhancing the emotional depth of communication. Ju et al. (2021) and Schoeller\n(2023) have demonstrated that combining vibrotactile feedback with visual or auditory cues\nsignificantly enhances emotional communication, further supporting the role of multimodal in-\nteraction in Affective Haptics [28, 46]. Unlike unimodal cues, such as auditory or visual signals,\nmultimodal haptic stimuli, including touch, evoke a stronger emotional response. According to\nChristensen (2015), emotional communication gains credibility and intensity when delivered\nthrough multiple sensory modalities, particularly in close proximity social contexts [14].\n2.2.2\nEmotional Framework for Affective Haptic Design\nCentral to the design of Affective Haptics is Russell’s Circumplex Model of Affect, which orga-\nnizes emotions along two axes: valence (positive-negative) and arousal (high-low) [45]. Build-\ning on Russell’s work, Posner et al. (2005) expanded this framework, arguing that emotions\nshould be viewed as fluid rather than discrete, meaning individuals can experience multiple\nemotions simultaneously. This nuance in emotional modeling is critical for haptic designers,\nwho must account for the complexity and overlap of emotional experiences when crafting tactile\nfeedback. The Posner theory of Russell’s Circumplex Model of Affect enables haptic systems\nto produce stimuli that capture this emotional depth, particularly in immersive environments\nwhere haptic feedback can convey more than one emotional state at a time [43].\nIncorporating the Circumplex Model of Affect into haptic design enables designers to categorize\nemotions effectively by valence and arousal. Research by Ju et al. (2021) have shown that\nvibrotactile feedback can serve as an effective medium for expressing a wide range of emotions.\nTheir findings suggest that vibrotactile feedback offers universal cues for emotional recognition,\nwith higher accuracy in emotions such as joy and anger [28].\nThis theoretical cognitive model is frequently used by the Affective Haptic Design community\nto better translate emotions into suitable haptic feedback, which informs the direction of the\nhaptic design to elicit specific emotional reactions. Pinpointing an area and sorting the desired\nUX on the matrix makes it easier to identify the general direction of expected emotional impact\nand haptic design properties. As previously said, the actual interpretation of feedback remains"}

(2009) emphasized that combining haptic stimuli with visual cues\nsignificantly enhances emotional communication, reinforcing the role of multimodal interac-\ntion in Affective Haptics [55]. Schoeller (2023) also explored how haptic feedback can be\naligned with specific emotional states, further highlighting how the sense of touch can facilitate\nemotional communication in immersive environments [46]. These studies demonstrate how Af-\nfective Haptics can enable deeper emotional engagement in digital interactions. While studies\nlike Ju et al. (2021) and Schoeller (2023) explore the potential of vibrotactile feedback for emo-\ntional engagement, novice interaction designers require tools that facilitate rapid iteration for\naffective haptic feedback design.\nMoussette (2012) presents a ‘sketching’ approach for simple haptics, enabling rapid prototyping\nand intuitive design iterations. This method significantly lowers the barrier for novice interac-\ntion designers, allowing them to quickly experiment with different tactile interactions without\ndeep technical expertise [37]. Israr et al. (2014) further explore how haptic feedback can enrich\nnarrative storytelling, demonstrating the potential of haptic stimuli to create emotionally engag-\ning experiences, especially in entertainment or immersive environments like virtual reality and\ngaming [26].\nTechnological advancements like artificial intelligence (AI) and faster computing systems have\nbroadened the potential for haptic design. Platforms like Haptipedia provide a comprehensive\ncatalog of haptic technology and when it was developed, aiding designers in understanding,\ndiscovering, and selecting appropriate haptic hardware for their research efforts [47]. Further,\nEid and Al Osman (2016) emphasize the role of haptic feedback in enhancing social commu-\nnication, particularly for visually impaired users, showing how Affective Haptics can improve\naccessibility and inclusive design [18].\nIn line with Walter (2011), the role of emotional interaction in design is crucial for creating\nmeaningful UXs. Affective Haptics, by leveraging the sense of touch, can offer a direct way to\nevoke and communicate emotions in digital environments. This supports the growing focus on\nemotional engagement in HCI [59].\nMy recent work and publication at the Eurohaptic Conference 2024 (G¨oke et al. (2024)) demon-\nstrate how Affective Haptics could influence emotional states, particularly in fostering relax-\nation through real-time haptic feedback that slows down and becomes less frequent to lower\nthe breath rate and thus inducing guided relaxation. Our ongoing research indicates how users\ncan respond emotionally to presumably affective haptic feedback, and how this feedback can\nbe fine-tuned through iterative design to achieve successful affective state changes with single-\nmodal haptic interactions [22].\n2.3\nEmotion Typology and the Circumplex Model\nTo guide the emotional responses elicited through haptic feedback, the Emotion Typology from\nTU Delft offers a structured approach to understanding and categorizing emotions [20].

The Circumplex Model of Af-\nfect organizes emotions along two axes — valence (positive-negative) and arousal (high-low)\n— offering a framework for mapping emotional experiences to haptic feedback [43, 45]. As\ndemonstrated by Ju et al. (2021) [28], this methodology was already used to map emotions\nto inform haptic feedback. In my workshop participants could use a combination of both to\nthen map the chosen emotion from the Emotion Typology into the 2D matrix of the Circum-\nplex Model of Affect, simplifying emotional states into their valence and arousal levels. By\nbreaking down complex emotions into simpler components using this typology, novice interac-\ntion designers can more easily align their haptic designs with the desired emotional responses.\nThe connection of these models forms the basis for the emotional mapping exercises within the\nproposed toolkit, aimed at enabling novice interaction designers to align tactile feedback with\nspecific emotional states during the design process.\nBy integrating the Emotion Typology from TU Delft, which categorizes emotions by their core\ncomponents, the toolkit allows novice interaction designers to align haptic design decisions\nwith emotional states systematically. These models provide a foundation for translating abstract\nemotions into tactile feedback, ensuring emotional resonance in haptic interactions.\n2.4\nWearable Technologies for Mental Wellness\nWearable technologies have rapidly evolved into sophisticated biofeedback systems capable of\nmonitoring a range of physiological signals like heart rate variability (HRV), electrodermal ac-\ntivity (EDA), and respiratory patterns. These metrics can offer real-time feedback for managing\nstress and emotional well-being through haptic stimulation [3]. Gonz´alez Ram´ırez et al. (2023)\nprovide a comprehensive review of these technologies, emphasizing their potential for stress\nmanagement through biofeedback integration. This review identifies key advancements in how\nwearables leverage emotional data to enhance user well-being in real-time [23], opening up\nthe possibility for haptic based stress interventions. Similaritly, Hickey et al. (2021) investi-\ngate the utility of wearable technology in the diagnosis and treatment of mental health issues,\nhighlighting the significant advantages of haptic and auditory feedback systems in effective\nindividualized approaches to anxiety and stress management [24].\nDrawing the connection to haptics, MacLean (2022) explores how affective haptic feedback can\nbe designed to support emotional well-being, particularly within wellness-focused applications.\nThe study examines the use of haptic feedback as a tool for emotional regulation, suggesting\nthat wearable technologies utilizing haptics can create calming, soothing sensations to help\nusers manage stress and anxiety. Integrating personalized haptic feedback into wellness appli-\ncations, such as meditation aids or stress-relief wearables, demonstrates the potential of these\nsystems to provide real-time emotional support [34]. Such systems allow users to engage with\ntheir emotions in real-time, promoting greater self-awareness and emotional regulation through\nphysical sensations [55]. This aligns with Hickey et al. (2021), who illustrates how wearable\nhaptic technologies are increasingly used in mental health contexts, integrating biofeedback\nmechanisms for individualized stress and anxiety management [24]."}

(2021) investigated the potential\nof personalized biofeedback systems to adjust to users’ emotional and physiological states in\nreal-time, providing targeted stress management interventions for everyday use. This study\npaves the way for future research into more advanced labeling strategies that may allow for\ncontext-aware, indivisualized models, which in turn will enable health professionals to offer\nmore tailored interventions [53].\nAlvarsson et al. (2010) studied the therapeutic effects of natural sounds on participants in\nstress recovery, suggesting that integrating auditory biofeedback with haptics could enhance\nthe effectiveness of wearables for mental health interventions [4]. Since haptic feedback often\nuses soundwaves delivered via “voice-coil actuators,” there is potential for sound and haptic\nfeedback to work together in promoting relaxation and emotional regulation. Combining haptic,\nauditory, and visual feedback improves the ability of wearables to offer personalized, multi-\nmodal interventions for managing stress and anxiety [2, 35].\nMulti-modal feedback systems, which can combine haptic, auditory, and visual stimuli, offer\nsignificant potential for creating more immersive UXs. Kim et al. (2024) explore the synchro-\nnization of haptic and auditory cues through cross-modal pitch matching, demonstrating how\ncombining sound and touch enhances users’ emotional engagement, especially in music ther-\napy and stress relief applications [30]. Jo et al. (2019) provided insights into how nature-based\nstimuli, such as auditory and visual inputs from forest environments, influence psychological\nwell-being [27]. The exposure to natural environment stimuli can positively influence psycho-\nlogical and physiological well-being suggests that combining these stimuli with haptic feedback\n— such as gentle vibrations or the sensation of walking in the forest or a sensation of wind —\ncould enhance wearable devices’ effectiveness in regulating emotions. Integrating these nature-\nbased stimuli with haptic biofeedback offers promising opportunities for stress management\nin mental wellness applications. Furthermore, this multi-modal emotional regulation research\ncould be especially valuable in contributing valuable knowledge to the under explored applica-\ntion of Affective Haptic Design principles.\nAs biofeedback technology improves, adding artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms will let\nwearables better predict how people are feeling and customize multi-modal feedback inter-\nventions based on real-time physiological data [1].\nThis approach could provide novel technologies that support users in situations where conven-\ntional self-regulation methods are not available (i.e., going for a walk, working out), depending\non the context of use (i.e., an office meeting, workday stress monitoring).\nAdditionally, AI-driven biofeedback is increasingly enhancing immersive feedback systems.\nAdvanced wearables equipped with AI could predict emotional states based on real-time data.\nThis would open the possibility to provide highly personalized intervention mechanisms tailored\nto the user’s emotional and physiological context ultimately supporting their mental health in\nreal-time.\nAs biofeedback systems become more sophisticated, the role of haptics in wearable technol-\nogy will continue to grow, offering real-time emotional interventions through tactile feedback\nsystems designed for stress management and emotional regulation yielding the potential for"}

In this regard,\nBreitschaft et al. (2022) propose the Haptic Fidelity Framework, which classifies haptic sys-\ntems based on their ability to convey perceptual effects, rather than purely on mechanical pre-\ncision. This framework introduces three fidelity levels — low (LoFi), medium (MidFi), and\nhigh-fidelity (HiFi) — allowing designers to match their system’s capabilities to the emotional\nengagement they intend to evoke.\nLoFi systems, such as simple vibrations, are useful for notification-based designs, offering\nstraightforward feedback. Medium-fidelity systems simulate mechanical interactions, like but-\nton clicks, with more detail, while high-fidelity systems enable rich, immersive sensations, such\nas textures or material properties, crucial in virtual reality (VR) and automotive applications.\nThis framework is particularly helpful for novice interaction designers by providing a struc-\ntured guide to choosing the appropriate technology based on the desired emotional outcomes.\nBy integrating this into their design process, novice interaction designers can match feedback\nfidelity to their project’s emotional and technical requirements, enhancing both the UX and the\nsystem’s emotional engagement [10].\nThe SkinKit construction toolkit developed by Ku et al. (2022) represents a significant ad-\nvancement in simplifying the development of on-skin interfaces. SkinKit offers a low-barrier,\nplug-and-play approach, making it easier for designers — particularly those without advanced\ntechnical expertise — to experiment with on-body interactions. The toolkit enables rapid, low-\nfidelity prototyping through flexible, skin-conformable modules, which are directly applicable\nto the skin. This approach is crucial for affective haptic design, where designers need to quickly\niterate on prototypes and test haptic feedback on the body to ensure emotional resonance [31].\nThe ability to quickly deploy functional on-skin prototypes and receive real-time feedback ac-\ncelerates the prototyping process, making it ideal for novice interaction designers working with\nAffective Haptics.\nIn a follow-up to SkinKit, Ku et al. (2023) introduced SkinLink, which further enhances the\nflexibility and adaptability of on-skin interface construction. SkinLink allows users to pro-\ntotype reconfigurable epidermal interfaces directly on the body, addressing the challenge of\niterating designs in situ. For affective haptic designers, SkinLink offers an intuitive, beginner-\nfriendly toolkit that adapts to dynamic and non-planar body surfaces, enabling them to create\nhaptic feedback systems that respond to emotional states in real-time. The system’s modular\napproach, combined with its focus on skin conformability and ease of modification, provides\nnovice interaction designers with a powerful tool to rapidly prototype and test emotional haptic\ninteractions on different body locations [32].\nThe SkinKit and SkinLink systems also support multi-modal feedback systems, combining hap-\ntic, visual, and auditory stimuli, which are essential for creating immersive and emotionally"}

For instance, in affective haptic design, combining haptic feedback\nwith other sensory modalities can deepen emotional engagement, particularly in applications\nsuch as mental wellness and stress management [31, 32]. These modular systems allow design-\ners to explore different sensory combinations, facilitating the creation of more holistic emotional\nexperiences.\nIn Moussette (2012), the concept of “simple haptics” is introduced to lower the complexity of\nhaptic design by providing basic tools and frameworks that encourage experimentation with\nhaptic stimuli. This method allows for an iterative design process where designers can fre-\nquently test and refine their work based on feedback, making it particularly valuable for novice\ninteraction designers who may lack deep technical expertise but still wish to create affective\nhaptic feedback [37].\nThe formentioned toolkits by Ku et al. (2022, 2023) align with Moussette’s (2012) ”simple hap-\ntics” concept, which emphasizes lowering the complexity of haptic design through basic tools\nand frameworks that encourage frequent experimentation with haptic stimuli. Both SkinKit and\nSkinLink reflect this philosophy by offering modular, reconfigurable systems that simplify com-\nplex design processes. By adopting this rapid, Lo-Fi prototyping approach, novice interaction\ndesigners can more easily test how different feedback patterns evoke specific emotions without\nbecoming bogged down in technical complexities. These toolkits enable novice interaction de-\nsigners to focus on emotional affect, iterating quickly to ensure that the haptic feedback they\ncreate aligns with the user’s emotional experience.\nBuilding on this idea, Moussette (2012) also proposes the concept of “sketching haptics,” which\nemphasizes quick, Lo-Fi experimentation. By treating haptic design similarly to how visual de-\nsigners sketch, this approach encourages designers to prototype tactile interactions using simple\ntools, enabling rapid iterations. The focus is on how different feedback patterns evoke specific\nemotions rather than on technical complexities. Through this iterative experimentation, design-\ners can align their haptic systems more effectively with user emotions and responses [38]. By\noffering these ‘sketching’ tools to novice interaction designers, the proposed toolkit can sim-\nplify complex design processes, enabling early prototyping and quick testing, which is crucial\nfor understanding how users emotionally respond to haptic feedback.\nIn addition to creating affective haptic feedback, ensuring comfort and realism is critical in de-\nsigning haptic devices. Shor et al. (2018) compare two VR gloves and emphasize that user\ncomfort, along with the haptic feedback quality, is crucial for maintaining immersion in virtual\nenvironments. Their study highlights the trade-offs between performance, comfort, and realism\nin designing haptic devices [48], which aligns with the need for novice interaction designers\nto consider both emotional and ergonomic factors when already developing LoFi haptic pro-\ntotypes. This work emphasizes the importance of well-designed, immersive haptic feedback\nbeing both technically accurate and comfortable for prolonged use which has implications for\nwearable technology development in healthcare as well.\nEmbodied Metaphor Elicitation\nEmbodied metaphors provide a powerful framework for\ntranslating abstract concepts into intuitive, physical interactions. As Bakker et al. (2012) em-\nphasize, embodied metaphors leverage human experiences of physical movement to make sense"}

Their work highlights how metaphorical\nmappings between input actions (e.g., physical movements) and output responses can enhance\ninteraction design [5]. While the original study focuses on tangible interactions, the iterative,\nuser-centered design approach proposed in their work — starting with enactment studies and\nmoving through Lo-Fi prototypes to validate metaphors — provides a valuable structure for\ndesigners.\nIn the context of Affective Haptics, this thesis extends Bakker’s framework to suggest that\nembodied metaphors can inform the creation of emotionally affective haptic feedback patterns.\nBy using embodied metaphors, novice interaction designers can map physical sensations onto\nabstract emotional states. For example, a “warm, soft touch” could represent comfort, while a\n“sharp, quick vibration” might indicate urgency. Although Bakker’s work does not explicitly\nfocus on haptic feedback, the idea of using embodied schemata — cognitive structures derived\nfrom sensorimotor experiences — can be adapted to design haptic feedback that resonates with\nusers’ emotions [17, 39].\nDaud´en Roquet and Sas (2021) take this further by exploring embodied metaphors in medita-\ntion, focusing on interoceptive interactions. They demonstrate how metaphors can map bodily\nsensations, such as warmth, to meditation states like mindfulness or mind-wandering. This ap-\nproach emphasizes the potential of using metaphor-inspired haptic feedback to influence emo-\ntional regulation, a key area for affective haptic design. By integrating thermal feedback, the\nauthors show that interoceptive experiences can deepen emotional engagement and attention\nregulation, thus extending metaphorical mappings beyond traditional sensory modalities [17].\nThis insight is particularly relevant for Affective Haptics, as it suggests that novice interaction\ndesigners could use embodied metaphors to map emotional experiences directly onto bodily\nsensations such as heat, pressure, or vibration.\nNardon and Hari (2021) further elaborate on the power of Imaginative Metaphor Elicitation\n(IME) to generate deep introspective understanding in participants. They found that metaphors\nhelp individuals articulate and make sense of complex, non-tangible experiences, facilitating a\nrenewed sense of empowerment and self-awareness. This aligns well with the goals of affec-\ntive haptic design, where metaphorical mappings can help users and designers bridge abstract\nemotional states with physical feedback mechanisms. IME’s emphasis on introspection and\nempowerment also supports novice interaction designers in Affective Haptics, providing them\nwith a structured yet intuitive method for eliciting meaningful emotional responses from users\n[39].\nThus, while Bakker et al. (2012) demonstrate that embodied metaphors facilitate the translation\nof abstract concepts into intuitive physical interaction design, this thesis builds on their work to\npropose that embodied metaphors can help to teach novice interaction designers how to create\nsingle-modal affective haptic feedback patterns that affect the emotional state within specified\nuser contexts.\nAdditionally taking into account the imaginative metaphor work by Daud´en Roquet and Sas, as\nwell as Nardon and Hari suggests that metaphors could allow designers to elicit rich, meaningful\nuser experiences by applying them with somatic and emotional states. This is particularly valu-\nable for designing single-modal Affective Haptics where designers must translate subjective,"}

In this way, embodied metaphor\nelicitation becomes a useful tool for enhancing the emotional effectiveness of haptic feedback\nsystems designed by novice interaction designers.\nBody Maps\nCochrane et al. (2022) and Turmo Vidal et al. (2023) discuss body maps as\na generative tool for capturing somatic experiences and emotions. Body maps allow users to\nvisually document complex and non-explicit emotions by marking body parts that are physically\nand emotionally significant during specific interactions [15, 56]. In Affective Haptic Design,\nbody maps can be particularly useful for identifying where emotional and tactile experiences\nconverge. By mapping out where users physically feel emotions such as anxiety, calm, or stress,\ndesigners can create haptic feedback systems that target specific areas of the body, enhancing\nthe emotional impact of haptic interactions.\nNummenmaa et al. (2014) extend this concept by revealing distinct bodily sensation maps\nassociated with a wide range of emotions. Their research shows that emotions such as happi-\nness, fear, and anger consistently activate distinct bodily regions, which are culturally universal\nacross West European and East Asian populations. For instance, happiness induces heightened\nsensations across the entire body, while fear predominantly activates the chest and upper body\n[41]. These findings provide a solid empirical foundation for the use of body maps in affective\nhaptic design, as they offer insight into how different emotions are somatically experienced and\nhow these patterns can be translated into tactile feedback.\nThe flexibility of body maps allows designers to record patterns of bodily sensations during in-\nteractions, which can guide the development of haptic devices that respond to these sensations.\nFor example, tracking changes in bodily experience over time could be crucial when designing\nhaptic wearables that assist in real-time emotional regulation. Additionally, body maps can sup-\nport the development of multi-modal feedback systems by integrating touch with other sensory\ninputs, such as sound or visual stimuli, to create more holistic emotional experiences.\nThis generative potential of body maps makes them an ideal tool for novice interaction designers\nworking with Affective Haptics. By capturing users’ somatic experiences, body maps offer\ninsights into how haptic feedback could be personalized to evoke or modulate specific emotional\nstates. The work by Nummenmaa et al. further reinforces the role of somatic feedback in\nemotional regulation and suggests that monitoring these bodily sensations could offer valuable\ninput for designing emotionally affective haptic systems [41]. In the proposed toolkit, body\nmaps could be used to prototype and evaluate the emotional effectiveness of different haptic\ndesigns, ensuring that the feedback aligns with users’ bodily and emotional responses.\nIn addition to these frameworks, projects like the Haptic Bits Lab4 demonstrate how acces-\n4https://lowingki.com/meet-the-haptic-bits-lab/"}

Vyas et al. (2023) highlight the\npotential for combining multiple sensory channels to create more immersive and emotionally\nengaging UXs [57]. For instance, the combination of tactile feedback with visual or auditory\ncues in virtual reality environments can make digital interactions feel more realistic and emo-\ntionally immersive.\nUnderlining this statement, Shor et al. (2021) explore the potential of multi-modal systems\nin creating emotionally affective experiences through the ‘Resonance Pod,’ a multisensory in-\nstallation combining haptics, sound, and light to promote relaxation. The study demonstrates\nhow haptic feedback, when synchronized with visual and auditory stimuli, can enhance emo-\ntional regulation, particularly in stress and anxiety management. This highlights the potential\nof multi-modal feedback systems in wearable technologies for mental wellness, where emo-\ntional engagement can be enhanced through cross-modal integration [49]. The success of such\nsystems underscores the importance of integrating multi-modal cues for novice interaction de-\nsigners seeking to design for emotional well-being.\nHaptic feedback’s potential for cross-modal interaction, such as the combination of sound and\ntouch, has also been explored by Kim et al. (2024), who demonstrated that cross-modal pitch\nmatching can enhance how users perceive tactile stimuli. This integration allows for richer\nemotional engagement by synchronizing haptic feedback with auditory cues, particularly in\napplications like music therapy and stress relief [30].\nThe future of Affective Haptics lies in its potential to revolutionize interpersonal communi-\ncation. Ju et al. (2021) explored how vibrotactile feedback could convey emotions such as\nempathy and support, offering users a tactile means of expressing complex emotional states\n[28]. Tsetserukou et al. (2009) proposed an affective haptic system, ”iFeel IM!”, that enhances\nemotional communication in virtual environments by simulating real-world social touch, such\nas hugs, through haptic devices [55].\nAffective Haptics research has increasingly drawn upon interdisciplinary collaboration, involv-\ning experts from fields such as neuroscience, psychology, and engineering. This collaboration\nhas led to significant advancements in haptic feedback design and evaluation, with new insights\ninto how touch influences emotional states. With the integration of diverse methodologies,\nresearchers started to address complex issues, such as emotional regulation and bio-sensing,\nthrough more robust haptic systems [57]. Research in Affective Haptics has increasingly fo-\ncused on emotion regulation, with many systems designed to help users manage stress and\nanxiety through biofeedback and tactile stimuli. Vyas et al. (2023) also note that over 50% of\nthe recent studies in AHSD have explored how haptics can be used to support emotional regula-\ntion, emphasizing the potential of these systems for mental health interventions. The evaluation"}

While non-clinical evaluations are important for early-stage\ndevelopment, there is a critical need for more rigorous, clinically validated studies. This would\nensure that affective haptic devices can effectively support emotional regulation and mental\nhealth interventions in real-world settings. These gaps underscore the need for more robust\nevaluation methods, particularly in clinical and real-world environments, to assess the impact\nand effectiveness of haptic devices in long-term emotional regulation [57].\nThis speaks for a growing need for advanced prototyping tools that enable real-time iteration\nand testing of AHSD. These tools would allow designers to refine haptic feedback based on im-\nmediate user feedback, making it easier to create emotionally effective haptic systems. As these\ntools evolve, they will lower barriers for novice interaction designers, enabling more efficient\nand user-centered design processes.\n2.7\nPrototyping and Real-Time Iteration\nBy enabling users and designers to actively engage with interactive haptic on-body prototype\nprocesses in real-world contexts (i.e. the interaction with their emotional object), Experience\nPrototyping, which Buchenau and Suri (2000) introduced, expands on participatory design\n[11] that suits the purpose of this workshop. This method in combination with the embod-\nied metaphor elicitation [5] and body mapping techniques from Soma Design [15, 41] is critical\nfor exploring complex systems where emotional and social interactions are central. By immers-\ning users in tangible experiences, it becomes possible to capture the nuances of user emotions\nand interactions connected to their chosen object. In the context of Affective Haptics, Experi-\nence Prototyping allows for the rapid testing and refinement of emotionally affective feedback,\nensuring that the emotional impact of haptic interactions is aligned with UXs in real-time en-\nvironments. By following their example to focus on Low-Fidelity (LoFi) prototypes to convey\nconcepts faster instead of focusing on the technical feasibility, this workshop emphasizes the\nimportance of rapid iteration and user feedback. Low-fidelity (LoFi) prototypes enable partici-\npants to quickly explore different haptic feedback patterns and adjust them based on real-time\nuser reactions. This approach fosters creativity and flexibility, allowing designers to focus on\nemotional resonance rather than technical constraints. The iterative cycles, in which partici-\npants alternated between the roles of designer and user, promoted empathy and a deeper under-\nstanding of the emotional states being conveyed. This iterative, hands-on process aligns with\nSch¨on’s concept of reflective practice [16], where designers learn through direct interaction and\ncontinuous refinement. By prioritizing emotional engagement and user-centered design, this\nprototyping method ensures that haptic feedback systems not only function technically but also\ncreate meaningful emotional connections.\nRapid prototyping is key to designing haptic systems that deliver precise emotional engage-\nment. Pane¨els et al. (2010) developed HITPROTO, a tool specifically designed for the rapid\nprototyping of haptic user interfaces. Such tools allow designers to make real-time adjustments\nto feedback mechanisms, ensuring that iterative testing is possible during the early design stages\nand making haptic design more accessible to novice interaction designers. This ability to test"}

HITPROTO also exemplifies the need for\nreal-time iteration and emotional mapping capabilities within affective haptic design.\n2.8\nEthical Considerations in Affective Haptics\nAs Affective Haptics become more advanced, increasingly integrated into everyday technology,\nand compatible with artificial intelligence algorithms, the field raises critical ethical concerns,\nincluding emotional manipulation, informed consent, cultural sensitivity, and data privacy. The\ndesign and deployment of these systems require robust frameworks to ensure that emotional and\npersonal boundaries are respected. The following papers reviewed here provide a comprehen-\nsive foundation for ethical practices within affective haptic design, aligned with the objectives\nof this research.\n2.8.1\nAutonomy, Consent, and User Control\nEid and Al Osman (2016) emphasize the necessity of user autonomy, asserting that haptic sys-\ntems must empower users to control their emotional experiences. Providing users with the\noption to modify or opt-out of emotional stimuli is essential to avoid unwanted emotional influ-\nence, particularly in sensitive environments like mental health interventions and social commu-\nnication [18]. Schoeller (2023) further highlights the potential risk of emotional manipulation in\nimmersive environments, noting that haptic feedback may unconsciously alter users’ emotional\nstates. This unintentional influence risks crossing ethical boundaries, necessitating thoughtful\nsystem design to maintain users’ agency and psychological safety [46].\nJu et al. (2021) introduce the concept of haptic empathy, exploring the ethical responsibilities\ninvolved in conveying emotional meaning through haptic interfaces. They stress that designers\nmust remain vigilant in ensuring that haptic stimuli do not overwhelm or manipulate users,\nrecommending iterative testing and close observation to maintain users’ emotional well-being\nduring interaction [28]. Similarly, Akshita et al. (2015) warn of the risks associated with\nmulti-modal systems. While the combination of visual and haptic stimuli can enhance user\nexperiences, it also carries the potential for overstimulation or unintended emotional arousal.\nTheir study underscores the importance of transparency and obtaining informed consent when\ndeploying such feedback systems [2].\n2.8.2\nData Privacy and Emotional Surveillance\nThe ethical management of emotional data emerges as a significant concern in the literature.\nVyas et al. (2023) explore the implications of using data-driven algorithms in real-time to pre-\ndict and influence users’ emotional states. They argue that while personalized haptic interven-\ntions can enhance emotional engagement, they also introduce the risk of emotional surveillance\nand potential misuse of emotional data [57]. Eid and Al Osman (2016) further stress that cultural\ndifferences in touch perception necessitate careful contextualization to avoid misinterpretation"}

They call for stronger ethical frameworks to guide data collection, storage, and\nusage, ensuring that users retain control over how their emotional responses are monitored and\nshared [18].\n2.8.3\nEmotional Dependency and Psychological Impact\nThe emotional impact of haptic feedback requires cautious consideration, particularly in vul-\nnerable populations. Macdonald et al. (2021) explore the role of calming haptics in addressing\nsocial anxiety, highlighting the benefits of these technologies in social environments. However,\nthey also caution against the risk of emotional dependence, where users might over-rely on these\nstimuli to regulate their emotional states. This dependency underscores the need for designers\nto carefully evaluate the psychological consequences of their interventions and to incorporate\nsafety mechanisms that promote emotional resilience [33].\nEid and Al Osman (2016) and Ju et al. (2021) advocate for collaborative development with clin-\nical professionals, especially in mental health contexts, to ensure that haptic designs are aligned\nwith therapeutic goals and do not inadvertently harm users. Integrating experts from psychol-\nogy and mental health fields can provide essential oversight, helping to safeguard participants’\nemotional well-being throughout the design process [18, 28].\n2.8.4\nCultural Sensitivity and Contextual Awareness\nDesigners must also consider the cultural contexts in which haptic systems are deployed. Tset-\nserukou et al. (2009) highlight the importance of cultural sensitivity when designing emotion-\nally resonant haptic feedback. Their research on virtual social interactions reveals that different\ncultures may interpret touch-based feedback in varying ways, posing challenges for universal\ndesign. They recommend adaptive systems that align with cultural norms to prevent miscom-\nmunication or discomfort [55].\nSimilarly, Ju et al. (2021) emphasize that emotional meanings conveyed through haptic inter-\nfaces must be calibrated according to users’ cultural expectations. They warn that failure to do\nso can result in unintended emotional responses, reducing the effectiveness of the system and\npotentially causing harm. This highlights the need for cross-cultural research and user-centered\ndesign processes that involve participants from diverse backgrounds [28].\n2.8.5\nAddressing Ethical Challenges Through Design\nGiven the profound psychological impact of Affective Haptics, this study was conducted with\ncareful attention to ethical considerations. Participants were fully informed about the nature of\nthe study and provided with opportunities to withdraw or modify their involvement at any stage.\nDuring emotionally sensitive discussions, care was taken to ensure that participants were not\npressured to share or engage beyond their comfort levels, and appropriate support was made"}

These practices align with the principles set forth by the American Psy-\nchological Association (2017), which emphasize transparency, respect for autonomy, and par-\nticipant well-being in research contexts 5.\nIn alignment with recommendations from Vyas et al. (2023) and Eid and Al Osman (2016),\nthe study also incorporated strategies to mitigate emotional manipulation risks. This included\nlimiting the emotional intensity of haptic stimuli and ensuring participants had control over\ntheir interactions. Moreover, participants’ data was handled with strict confidentiality, adhering\nto data privacy standards and ensuring that emotional responses were not shared beyond the\nresearch context without consent.\n2.8.6\nRemark\nThe integration of Affective Haptics into everyday technology presents unique ethical chal-\nlenges that must be navigated with care. This study has drawn from established ethical frame-\nworks and best practices to ensure participant well-being, transparency, and respect for personal\nand cultural differences. Future research should continue to refine these practices, incorporat-\ning multidisciplinary perspectives and developing adaptive, user-centered systems that prioritize\nautonomy, emotional safety, and cultural sensitivity. By adhering to these principles, affective\nhaptic technologies can be harnessed to enhance emotional well-being without compromising\nethical integrity.\n2.9\nSummary\nThe field of HCI has undergone significant evolution, from its early focus on usability and ef-\nficiency in the first wave, to its current emphasis on emotional, experiential, and social dimen-\nsions in the third wave. Affective Haptics, which uses tactile feedback to evoke or communicate\nemotions, aligns with this third wave by focusing on enhancing emotional engagement through\npersonalized and immersive UXs. As technologies such as wearable devices and virtual reality\ninterfaces grow in prevalence, the potential for affective haptic feedback to foster or regulate\nuser emotions has become a key area of research.\nDespite its potential, Affective Haptics, specifically single-modal haptic feedback, remains\ntechnically complex and inaccessible to set up for novice interaction designers and researchers.\nCurrent haptic toolkits often require advanced technical skills, which limits the ability of new\ndesigners to experiment with and integrate affective haptic feedback into their work. To ad-\ndress this gap, this thesis proposes a modular toolkit that simplifies the design of single-modal\naffective haptic feedback, drawing from established frameworks and methodologies such as\nbody maps (soma design), embodied metaphors (psychology, and cognitive neuroscience), the\nCircumplex Model of Affect (behavioral, cognitive neuroscience), and Experience Prototyping\n(interaction design).\n5https://www.apa.org/ethics/code"}

The study combines theoretical frameworks, such as an Emotion\nTypology [20] and the Circumplex Model of Affect [43] with practical prototyping tools and\nframeworks like Experience Prototyping, body maps, and embodied metaphor elicitation [5,\n11, 15, 56] to facilitate the learning and prototyping process of novice interaction designers for\naffective haptic feedback.\n3.1\nParticipant Selection and Recruitment\nThe careful structuring of the participant selection for this study ensured that the modular\ntoolkit’s intended audience — novice interaction designers with little prior experience in de-\nsigning AHFS — could test it. The study aimed to assess how well the toolkit facilitated the\nlearning process for individuals unfamiliar with haptics, while also ensuring diversity in back-\nground and experience level to capture a broad range of perspectives.\n3.1.1\nRecruitment Process\nParticipants were students with a background in HCI and a background in coding front-end\ninterfaces, targeting students enrolled in courses related to interaction design, UX design and\nresearch, and front-end development. The primary criteria for participant selection were as\nfollows:\n1. Novice in Haptic Design: Participants were required to have little to no prior experience in\ndesigning haptic feedback systems. This ensured that study participants for the toolkit workshop\nwould be novice interaction designers and researchers who represent its primary target audience\n— designers with a basic understanding of interaction design but without a background in haptic\ndesign or coding haptic feedback.\n2. Interest in Affective Haptics: Participants were selected based on their expressed interest in\nlearning about Affective Haptics, as indicated in the recruitment phase of this thesis workshop.\nThis was done to ensure participants had intrinsic motivation and were eager to engage with the\nemotional aspects of haptic feedback and share honest feedback about the methodology toolkit\nangle and effectiveness to teach them single-modal Affective Haptic Design.\n3. Diverse Backgrounds: To capture a wide range of insights, participants from various disci-\nplines within HCI and design were selected, including those with backgrounds in:\n• digital concept development,\n• UX design,"}
{"doc_id": "Vincent_Master_Thesis0225.pdf", "page": 39, "text": "3\nMETHODOLOGY\n26\n• industrial product design,\n• psychology & cognitive sciences, and\n• multimedia technology development.\nThis diversity helped assess the toolkit’s usability across different fields within the design, soft-\nware & hardware development, and cognitive science communities.\n4. International and Language Diversity: Given the global nature of design communities,\nparticipants included only non-native English speakers to evaluate how well the toolkit commu-\nnicated complex emotional and technical concepts to a linguistically diverse group.\n3.1.2\nParticipant Demographics\nA total of six participants were recruited for the study, divided into three pairs. Each pair\nworked together throughout the workshop sessions to foster collaboration and mutual learning.\nThe small group size allowed for in-depth interaction with the toolkit during the workshop\nand ensured that participants received sufficient guidance and time for feedback during the\nworkshop.\nGender Balance: Efforts were made to include both male and female participants to explore\nany potential gender differences in emotional perception and response to haptic feedback. All\npairs were paired up differently to have all possible combinations(i.e. 1: (W, M) 2: (M, M) 3:\n(W, W)).\nAge Range: Participants ranged in age from 22 to 30 years, reflecting the typical demographic\nof postgraduate design students and early-career professionals.\nCultural and Educational Backgrounds: Participants came from varied cultural backgrounds,\nensuring a diverse set of perspectives on the emotional interpretation of haptic stimuli. This\ndiversity also helped assess the toolkit’s applicability across different cultural contexts. As\nshown in subsection 4.1, the participants had varied backgrounds, which enriched the workshop\ndiscussions and outcomes. Each phase of the workshop, detailed in Sections 3.2.4 to 3.2.7, was\ncarefully designed to build upon the previous one, guiding participants through the process of\ndesigning affective haptic feedback using the toolkit’s modular methodological processes.\n3.1.3\nParticipant Pairing\nAll six participants were divided into 3 pairs to reflect the Tandem Design approach used in\nthe study. The pairing was done strategically to mix different skill levels, ensuring that each\npair had complementary strengths in either the theoretical or practical aspects of design and\nidentified challenges that could be better weighted, based on the interpretation of the feedback\nand correlation to the participants’ professional background. For example, BP1 had significant\nexperience with prototyping tangible interactive products, making that participant a suitable"}

This setup consideration along all three\ngroups promoted peer learning.\nCollaborative Learning: By working in pairs, participants engaged in continuous feedback\nloops, which are crucial for iterative prototyping. One participant would act as the designer,\ncreating and adjusting the haptic feedback, while the other acted as the test subject, providing\nimmediate feedback on the emotional impact of the design. This collaborative structure mim-\nicked real-world design environments where teamwork is essential. These instructions were not\nset as rigid role assignments but rather as a guideline to ensure participants had a starting point\nand worked collaboratively on their AHSD.\n3.1.4\nSelection Rationale\nThe selection criteria aimed to create a participant group representative of novice interaction\ndesigners who might use the toolkit in real-world scenarios to develop haptic designs. The\nchoice of recruiting students as described in the diverse background paragraph3.1.1, but were\nstill unfamiliar with the specifics of affective haptic technology and its design. This balance\nwas important for the exploratory nature of the research and for addressing the gap between\nconceptualizing single-modal affective haptic feedback design and technical haptic on-body\nprototyping.\nWith the selected participants fulfilling the criteria described previously, the workshop was able\nto assess not only the usability of the toolkit but also its capacity to support a wide range of\nusers in different design contexts. This diversity in selection also ensured that any challenges\nrelated to learning curves, certain cultural interpretations of emotional feedback, and collabo-\nrative design dynamics could be identified and addressed in the final evaluation of the toolkit’s\nproposition.\nParticipants were asked to bring an object of their choice that they have an emotional connection\nto and are willing to share details about in a group setting. They were informed that during the\nworkshop conduction, they would be working in a Tandem Setup, in which participants were\npaired up and supposed to communicate their preferences to another fellow designer or elicit\nthe emotional triggers for another participant’s object.\n3.1.5\nInformed Consent and Ethical Considerations\nThe study was conducted in adherence to strict ethical guidelines to ensure the protection of\nparticipant rights, privacy, and well-being throughout the research process. This subsection de-\ntails the procedures followed to secure informed consent, maintain confidentiality, and address\nethical concerns related to the emotional nature of Affective Haptic Design.\nInformed Consent Procedure\nBefore the beginning of the study, all participants were re-\nquired to provide informed consent (see Appendix 57). This process was designed to ensure"}

The consent form was sent to the\nparticipants 2 weeks before the workshop date and was filled out and received before starting\nthe workshop.\nInformation Briefing\n: Each participant received a comprehensive information sheet that\noutlined the study’s objectives, the workshop structure, the specific tasks they would engage in,\nand the types of data that would be collected. This document also provided a brief overview of\nhaptic technology and the relevant methodologies mentioned in the introduction of this method-\nology section3, and the significance of their involvement in the study.\nConsent Forms\n: After reviewing the information sheet, participants were asked to sign the\ninformed consent form, indicating their voluntary participation. The consent form covered key\naspects such as:\n• The purpose of the study of testing a combination of methodologies to teach single-modal\nAffective Haptic Design and the participant’s role.\n• The right to withdraw from the study at any time without any penalty or explanation.\n• Assurance of anonymity and confidentiality regarding any personal data collected.\n• Consent to the collection of qualitative data (e.g., demographic survey, voice recorded\ndiscussion rounds, body maps, embodied metaphor sheets, haptic design patterns) and\nquantitative data (e.g., experience levels, haptic feedback patterns).\n• The use of photographs or screenshots of the workshop setup, procedure, and Miro board\ncontent provided that no identifiable personal information was included in such materials.\nVoluntary Participation\n: The informed consent process emphasized that participation was\nentirely voluntary, and participants were informed that they could withdraw at any time, with\nno negative consequences for their academic standing or professional reputation.\n3.2\nResearch Design\nThis study utilizes a Tandem Design methodology, where participants work in pairs to design\nhaptic feedback systems. This approach mimics real-world collaborative design processes often\nfound in professional environments and emphasizes user-centered design based on the Experi-\nence Prototyping approach of Buchenau and Suri in 2000 [11]. Each pair consists of two novice\ninteraction designers who work together to iterate on their on-body haptic prototypes, providing\nfeedback and making adjustments in real-time.\nThe workshop followed a multi-phase structure, designed to build participants’ skills in Af-\nfective Haptic Design incrementally.

Participants initially explored embodied metaphors, using body maps to ex-\npress emotional associations with their objects. This phase was followed by iterative on-body\nprototyping, where participants used the Hapticlabs DevKit to design feedback patterns. The\nstructured flow ensured a balance between emotional reflection and technical skills, which was\nintended to foster a gradual learning curve. However, qualitative feedback highlighted some\nissues with transitioning between phases, particularly related to the technical limitations of the\nhardware, such as connectivity problems and limited actuator types, which impacted the creative\nexploration of emotional design patterns (BP2, CP1).\nEach tandem group was instructed to engage with an ’emotional object’ that they brought to the\nworkshop. These objects were introduced during an initial presentation round where partici-\npants described the emotions associated with their objects and used a body map to note areas of\nemotional resonance (see the result section 4). This phase allowed participants to reflect on how\nemotions were felt physically, mapping their object-related emotions to specific body parts. For\nexample, Participant AP2 linked their object (a ring) to a feeling of support and admiration,\nmapping these emotions onto the chest and neck area. These body maps were then used as a\nbasis for placing haptic actuators during the on-body prototyping sessions. Additionally, par-\nticipants were guided through embodied metaphor elicitation, where metaphors linked to their\nobjects (e.g., ’soft but supportive’) were translated into vibration patterns.”\nWorkshop Room Setup\nThe workshop provided participants with a range of resources to\nfacilitate both the theoretical understanding and practical application of haptic design. These\nmaterials were thoughtfully curated to guide participants through each phase of the workshop,\nenabling them to engage with the emotional, metaphorical, and physical aspects of haptic feed-\nback design.\nFigure 1: The workshop room setup with a U-shaped table arrangement and a projector display-\ning the Miro board for all participants.

[5] and was newly created for this\nworkshop that can be examined in Figure 5. This worksheet guided participants through an in-\ndepth exploration of the personal object they brought to the workshop, asking them to reflect on\nthe emotional significance and sensory characteristics of the object. The template was divided\ninto sections that helped participants articulate their thoughts systematically:\n• Object Identification: Participants noted the object’s name, the emotion it represented,\nand why it was personally meaningful.\n• Physical Characteristics: This section focused on sensory details such as texture, weight,\ntemperature, and any other qualities that could serve as metaphors for emotions.\n• Personal Connection Context: Participants detailed associated memories or experiences\nthat gave emotional weight to the object.\n• Metaphorical Translation: This section prompted participants to brainstorm how the\nobject’s physical attributes could be transformed into haptic feedback, considering the\ncontext in which such feedback could be used and how it might evoke similar emotions\nin others.\nThe worksheet also included space for discussions with their tandem partner, allowing for feed-\nback and the refinement of ideas. This process helped participants bridge the gap between\nemotional experience and technical prototyping, ensuring a thoughtful approach to design.\nBody Map Templates\nThe body map templates were essential for documenting how partic-\nipants physically experienced emotions in their bodies. Participants were provided with both\nmale and female body maps, enabling them to mark areas where they felt specific emotions\nrelated to the object they brought to the workshop. This exercise gave participants a visual\nreference for identifying emotional hotspots on the body, which later informed their decisions\nabout where to place haptic feedback actuators during prototyping.\nThe following Figures 6 and Figure 7 present the body map templates provided to participants\nduring the workshop, tailored for both male and female participants and taken as a royalty-free"}

They can then turn the derived valance and arousal into tactile sensations that can\nhave emotional meaning for the user. To test H11.4, I implemented embodied metaphors and\nbody maps in the design process and evaluated their impact on communication effectiveness\namong novice interaction designers.\nMiro Online Platform\nThe Miro Online Platform was used as a collaborative workspace\nwhere participants were presented with informative slides as explained in the next sections and\ndocumented their design processes. Using this platform allowed participants to:\n• Upload Body Maps and Templates: Participants could photograph their completed body\nmaps and upload them to Miro and fill out metaphor elicitation sheets for easy reference\nduring the prototyping phase with their tandem partner.\n• Create Visual Notes: The platform’s virtual sticky notes and drawing tools enabled par-\nticipants to jot down ideas, sketch feedback mechanisms, and annotate their designs.\n• Track Feedback and Iterations: Miro allowed participants to share their work with\ntheir Tandem Design partners, facilitating real-time feedback and iterative design im-\nprovements.\n• Organize Prototypes: Participants used Miro to document and share photos of their\nprototypes, making the process of refining and testing designs more interactive and col-\nlaborative.\nMiro served as a vital tool for content presentation, organizing ideas, tracking progress, and\nensuring collaboration between Tandem Design partners and all workshop participants.\nEmotion Typology and Circumplex Model of Affect\nTwo theoretical frameworks — the\nEmotion Typology and the Circumplex Model of Affect — were provided to help participants\nunderstand the emotional spectrum and map emotions onto haptic feedback patterns.\n• Emotion Typology: Developed by the Delft Institute of Positive Design, this tool cate-\ngorized emotions into pleasant and unpleasant states, providing participants with a wide\nrange of emotional descriptors.

By using this model, participants could\nclassify their emotional experiences and map them to specific haptic feedback designs.\nFor example, high-arousal positive emotions might correspond to rapid, intense vibra-\ntions, while low-arousal negative emotions might call for subtle, slow feedback."}
{"doc_id": "Vincent_Master_Thesis0225.pdf", "page": 52, "text": "3\nMETHODOLOGY\n39\nThe combination of these materials and resources created a comprehensive environment in\nwhich participants could explore, document, and design AHFS. By integrating theoretical frame-\nworks, practical tools, and collaborative platforms, the workshop aimed to equip novice interac-\ntion designers with both the knowledge and hands-on experience needed to engage with Affec-\ntive Haptic Design and gain valuable insights into answering the research questions. The use of\ntemplates, guiding questions, and body maps fostered a deeper understanding of how emotions\nmanifest in the body. At the same time, the Hapticlabs DevKit enabled participants to translate\nthese insights into experimental, tangible haptic experiences.\n3.2.2\nTandem Design Approach\nThe Tandem Design approach is a key component of the workshop methodology, facilitating\nboth collaborative learning and iterative prototyping. In this approach, participants work in\npairs, alternating between the roles of designer and user. This method builds on principles from\nparticipatory design and Experience Prototyping [11, 50], allowing participants to actively en-\ngage in both the creative process of designing and the experiential process of receiving and\nevaluating haptic feedback. By switching roles, participants gain a comprehensive understand-\ning of both perspectives, which is essential for designing affective haptic feedback.\nRoleplaying in Experience Prototyping\nRoleplaying is an integral part of the Tandem De-\nsign approach. In each pair, one participant takes on the role of the designer, responsible\nfor creating and adjusting the haptic feedback, while the other participant acts as the user,\nexperiencing the haptic feedback and providing real-time feedback based on their emotional re-\nsponses. This approach encourages participants to think beyond their own experiences, engag-\ning in role reversal to better understand how haptic feedback can be designed to elicit specific\nemotional responses in others.\nExperience Prototyping, as outlined by Buchenau and Suri [11], emphasizes the importance\nof firsthand experience in the design process. By roleplaying both as a designer and user,\nparticipants can explore how haptic feedback interacts with emotional states, bodily sensations,\nand contextual factors. This not only helps participants refine their prototypes but also fosters\nempathy, as they are required to consider their partner’s emotional and physical experiences.\nThe Tandem Design approach mimics real-world collaborative environments but is particularly\nsuited for emotional haptic design due to its emphasis on continuous peer feedback and iterative\nrefinement, as supported by studies in Affective Haptics and participatory design mentioned in\nthe introduction and related work section of this thesis12.\nDesigner Role The designer uses the Hapticlabs DevKit (see Section 4) to create on-body\nhaptic feedback patterns, drawing from the embodied metaphor elicitation and body map tem-\nplates to guide their design decisions. They are encouraged to consider the user’s feedback\nin real-time, making iterative adjustments to the intensity, frequency, and patterns of the hap-\ntic feedback. The designer is also responsible for documenting the prototyping process, using\nplatforms like Miro to track changes and refine ideas."}
{"doc_id": "Vincent_Master_Thesis0225.pdf", "page": 53, "text": "3\nMETHODOLOGY\n40\nUser Role The user’s role is equally critical in the Tandem Design approach. As they expe-\nrience the haptic feedback, they provide detailed feedback on how the sensations align with\nthe emotional and physical experiences mapped during earlier phases. Users are encouraged\nto reflect on the quality and emotional resonance of the feedback, making annotations on their\nbody maps to document areas where the feedback feels most relevant or effective. This ongoing\ndialogue between user and designer forms a continuous feedback loop, essential for refining the\nprototype.\nPeer Learning and Feedback Working in pairs also facilitates peer learning, as participants\nare not only engaged in the design process but are also learning from one another’s insights and\nfeedback. This aligns with principles from participatory design, where collaboration and shared\nownership of the design process are emphasized [50]. As participants alternate between roles,\nthey must articulate their design rationale and provide constructive feedback to their partner.\nThis back-and-forth dialogue ensures that both participants contribute to and learn from the\ndesign process, fostering a deeper understanding of creating AHFS.\nMutual Feedback Loops: The Tandem approach allows for continuous feedback loops, where\nthe designer receives real-time input from the user and adjusts the design accordingly. This\nprocess is iterative and dynamic, reflecting the principles of participatory and Experience Pro-\ntotyping [16]. The immediate feedback helps to refine the haptic feedback designs in ways that\nare responsive to the emotional and physical needs of the user, ensuring that the final design is\nboth effective and meaningful.\nProblem-Solving and Collaboration: The collaborative nature of the Tandem Design ap-\nproach encourages problem-solving, as participants must work together to address design chal-\nlenges. For instance, if the user finds the haptic feedback too intense or unaligned with their\nemotional state, the designer must quickly adapt and explore new patterns or placements. This\niterative problem-solving process reflects real-world design team dynamics, where collabora-\ntion and communication are critical to achieving successful outcomes. By working together,\nparticipants learn to balance technical feasibility with emotional impact, a key skill in Affective\nHaptic Design.\nRole Reversal and Reflective Practice\nA crucial aspect of the Tandem Design approach is the role reversal that occurs midway through\nthe workshop. After the first round of prototyping, participants switch roles, allowing the de-\nsigner to become the user and vice versa. This shift is essential for fostering a holistic under-\nstanding of the design process, as participants experience both the creation and reception of\nhaptic feedback. Role reversal also encourages reflective practice, as participants must reflect\non their own experiences as users to inform their design decisions when they switch to the\ndesigner role.\nReflective practice is a key concept in design thinking, where designers are encouraged to reflect\non their experiences and use those reflections to improve their designs [16]. By experiencing\ntheir own designs from the user’s perspective, participants gain valuable insights into how their\ndesign choices affect the emotional and physical experiences of the user. This reflection helps\nto refine and improve the design, ensuring that the final haptic feedback system is not only\ntechnically sound but also emotionally affective."}
{"doc_id": "Vincent_Master_Thesis0225.pdf", "page": 54, "text": "3\nMETHODOLOGY\n41\nReal-time Reflection:\nAfter each round of roleplaying, participants engage in brief reflec-\ntion sessions, discussing their experiences as both designer and user. These discussions help\nparticipants identify key design decisions and reflect on their rapid on-body prototyping, fos-\ntering a deeper understanding of how to create effective haptic feedback systems. Participants\nare encouraged to document their reflections in Miro, creating a record of their iterative design\nprocess and the lessons learned from each round of prototyping.\nEnhancing Iterative Prototyping\nThe Tandem Design approach also enhances the iterative\nnature of prototyping, as participants continuously refine their designs based on feedback from\ntheir design partner. This iterative process is critical for Affective Haptic Design, where small\nadjustments to haptic feedback can have a significant impact on the emotional resonance of\nthe system. By alternating between roles and continuously gathering feedback, participants\ncan refine their prototypes in real-time, ensuring that the final design is both emotionally and\nphysically engaging.\nRapid Prototyping Cycles:\nThe workshop is structured around rapid prototyping cycles,\nwhere participants are encouraged to make quick, iterative design adjustments. This approach is\ninformed by Experience Prototyping practices, where the focus is on creating a tangible experi-\nence that can be rapidly tested and refined through the direct feedback of the on-body prototype\nexperience [11]. By iterating quickly, participants can test multiple versions of their haptic\nfeedback systems directly on the user, gathering insights from each iteration and using them to\nimprove the final design.\nSimulating Real-World Design Environments\nFinally, the Tandem Design approach simu-\nlates real-world design environments, where designers often work in teams and must balance\nmultiple perspectives and feedback sources. In a professional setting, designers must not only\nconsider their own vision but also take into account the needs and preferences of users, clients,\nand collaborators. By working in pairs, participants in the workshop experience this dynamic\nfirsthand, learning to balance their own creative ideas with the feedback and insights provided\nby their partners.\nThe collaborative, feedback-driven nature of the Tandem Design approach helps to prepare par-\nticipants for real-world design challenges, where communication, empathy, and iteration are\nessential for success. By the end of the workshop, participants have gained both the techni-\ncal skills and the collaborative mindset needed to design emotionally AHFS in a professional\ncontext.\nThe Tandem Design approach is a powerful method for fostering peer learning, collaboration,\nand iterative design in the context of Affective Haptics. By alternating between the roles of\ndesigner and user, participants gain a comprehensive understanding of both the technical and\nemotional aspects of haptic feedback design. This approach not only enhances the prototyping\nprocess but also encourages empathy, reflective practice, and collaborative problem-solving, all\nof which are essential skills for creating effective and meaningful haptic systems."}

First and foremost,\ninformed consent was obtained from all participants, with a thorough explanation of the study’s\nobjectives, procedures, and any potential risks. Participants were briefed on the voluntary nature\nof their involvement, with the assurance that they could withdraw from the study at any time\nwithout any consequence. The consent forms clearly outlined how personal data, including any\nemotional or physiological feedback gathered during the workshops, would be anonymized to\nprotect the privacy of participants (see Appendix 57.\nGiven the sensitive nature of some of the emotional and physiological data involved in haptic\nfeedback design, particular attention was paid to data handling. Emotional experiences, body\nmapping annotations, and feedback related to the emotional resonance of haptic prototypes were\ntreated with utmost confidentiality. The data was anonymized, with any identifying information\nbeing removed before analysis. Additionally, the research followed strict data storage protocols,\nensuring that all information was securely stored and only accessible to authorized researchers\ninvolved in the project.\nThe study also emphasized emotional sensitivity throughout the workshop. Participants were\nencouraged to engage with positive emotional experiences, particularly in the metaphor elicita-\ntion and body mapping phases, to avoid inducing discomfort or distress. To further safeguard\nparticipants, the body mapping exercise — which involved identifying areas of the body where\nemotions were felt — was conducted with careful consideration of privacy and participant com-\nfort. No sensitive areas were explored, and participants were instructed to disclose only what\nthey were comfortable sharing.\nIn addition to protecting participant data, the study’s ethical framework also emphasized the\nreciprocal nature of feedback in the Tandem Design methodology. The role reversal between\ndesigner and user not only encouraged empathy but also ensured that participants experienced\nthe emotional and physical implications of their prototypes designed for another personalized\nUX. This helped mitigate the risk of unintended emotional or sensory discomfort in the final\nprototypes. Participants were constantly reminded that they had the right to pause or modify\nthe activities if they felt uncomfortable at any stage.\nThe study’s framework was further aligned with broader ethical principles within HCI and Af-\nfective Haptics, including respect for user agency, attention to emotional impact, and the im-\nportance of inclusivity in design. Ethical considerations thus shaped the study’s design from\ninception to data analysis, ensuring a respectful, safe, and emotionally aware research environ-\nment.\nThe four steps of the toolkit testing workshop are designed to ensure a cumulative learning\nexperience and enough participant feedback to make informed decisions for the next iteration\nof the methodological toolkit for Affective Haptic Design.

This model serves as a key theoretical tool for guiding partic-\nipants in mapping emotional states to haptic feedback patterns. This phase provides participants\nwith the necessary background to think critically about the emotional and technical components\nof haptic design.\nEmotion Typology:\nParticipants are introduced to the Emotion Typology, developed by the\nDelft Institute of Positive Design. This tool categorizes a wide range of emotions and serves as a\nconceptual framework to help participants understand the various emotional responses [20] that\nhaptic feedback could be designed for and have a reference that also supports non-native English\nspeakers to articulate their emotions precisely. The Emotion Typology by the Delft University\nof Technology is an open-access online database that contains thorough information on both\npositive and negative emotions, which suits this toolkit approach. It contains descriptions about\n60 emotions, 24 of which are pleasant and 36 negative.\nFor each emotion, the database contains the following information:\n• Formal definition of the emotion\n• Explanation of causes and responses\n• Three clips from popular movies expressing that emotion\n• Typical verbal expressions\n• Cartoon mini-story (currently available for negative emotions only)\n• Comparisons with similar emotions (currently available for negative emotions only)\n• References to scientific sources for further reading on emotions\nIn this thesis, the framework is used as a foundation for recognizing, identifying, and defin-\ning emotions during the design process. At the beginning of the workshop, participants were\nasked to place a colored dot on the emotion they felt right now to start the engagement and\nspark their interest in exploring the Emotion Typology. For the sake of straightforwardness, the\ncolor codes for emotions from the Emotion Typology were not used and were chosen by the\nparticipants based on personal preference. Also, participants were asked to pick positive emo-\ntions for this workshop to avoid unpleasant experiences during the object metaphor elicitation,\nbody mapping, or prototyping sessions which aligns with the initiative of the Emotion Typology\nauthors Delft Institute of Positive Design."}

More information about\nthe Emotion Typology can be found at https://emotiontypology.com/.\nCircumplex Model of Affect:\nBuilding on the Emotion Typology, participants are introduced\nto the Circumplex Model of Affect [43], which plots emotions along two dimensions: valence\n(positive-negative) and arousal (high-low). This model provides a systematic way to map emo-\ntions to haptic feedback as described in section 2.3.\nFigure 10: Workshop participants placing their emotions on the Circumplex Model of Affect\n[43, 45].

Haptic feedback, as outlined in this ses-\nsion, refers to the use of touch sensations to communicate information to users through forces,\nvibrations, or motions applied by a device. This can enhance interactions by providing tactile\nsignals, particularly in environments where visual or auditory feedback may be insufficient or\noverloaded. Participants were introduced to key terminology, including the distinction between\nsingle-modal experiences, where one sense is stimulated, and multi-modal experiences, where"}
{"doc_id": "Vincent_Master_Thesis0225.pdf", "page": 58, "text": "3\nMETHODOLOGY\n45\nmultiple senses such as sight, hearing, and touch are combined.\nThe session further differentiated between two primary forms of perception relevant to haptic\nfeedback: kinaesthetic perception, which relates to muscle and joint feedback (such as “I feel\nhow full my glass is”), and tactile perception, which involves the skin’s receptor feedback re-\ngarding texture, material, vibration, and temperature. These perceptions play crucial roles in\nthe design and reception of haptic systems, particularly in emotionally affective feedback.\nParticipants also got an introduction into the various types of haptic feedback, such as passive\nhaptics, where physical object attributes like texture and weight are considered, and active hap-\ntics, which involve electric components like vibration motors and vibrotactile actuators. For\nthe workshop, the focus was primarily on active tactile feedback systems, as these technologies\nallow for finer control and are central to many Affective Haptic Design projects.\nThroughout this warm-up lecture, participants were made aware that haptic feedback is in-\nherently personal, culturally specific, and context-dependent. This haptic introduction made\nparticipants familiar with the basics of tactile perception and how to evaluate and refine haptic\nfeedback systems in a design context. This introductory phase drew heavily on resources from\nHapticlabs’ tutorial on haptic feedback, ensuring that participants had a solid technical founda-\ntion before moving on to hands-on prototyping activities with the Hapticlabs DevKit which will\nbe discussed in more detail in the material section. More information on this tutorial is available\nthrough the Hapticlabs website9.\nMapping Everyday Haptics to the Circumplex Model of Affect:\nTo reinforce the theoreti-\ncal frameworks, participants engage in an exercise where they are asked to recall and categorize\neveryday haptic experiences (e.g., the vibration of a mobile phone, the feel of a door closing,\nor a heartbeat simulation). They are, again, instructed to place these examples on the Circum-\nplex Model of Affect, considering how the sensation corresponds to different combinations of\nvalence and arousal. This exercise helps participants to get familiar with the emotion simplifi-\ncation process, actively engage with the emotional dimensions of haptic feedback and apply the\nframeworks to real-world examples.\nThe Circumplex Model of Affect was used to create an overview of haptic technology and hap-\ntic feedback they already know from everyday life. This phase aimed at giving a terminology\noverview of emotions in the English language, learning to simplify emotional stimuli onto the\nCircumplex Model of Affect. To introduce haptic technologies, explaining how actuators work,\nthe types of tactile sensations (e.g., vibrations, pressure) that can be generated, and how these\nsensations are mapped to emotional experiences guided them into the first exercise of sorting\nhaptic technologies they already are familiar with into the Circumplex Model of Affect, mani-\nfesting the concept of deriving an emotion into an interpretation of valance and arousal.\nFollowing this theoretical introduction, participants are guided through key emotional frame-\nworks that will serve as the basis for their haptic design process:\n9https://www.hapticlabs.io/tutorial"}

Through structured activities, participants explore the emotional resonance of objects\nthey brought with them and begin to associate specific bodily sensations with these emotions.\nEach tandem group was instructed to engage with an emotional object that they brought to the\nworkshop. These objects were introduced during an initial presentation round where partici-\npants described the emotions associated with their objects and used a body map to note areas\nof emotional resonance. This phase allowed participants to reflect on how emotions were felt\nphysically, mapping their object-related emotions to specific body parts. For example, Partic-\nipant AP2 linked their object (a ring) to a feeling of support and admiration, mapping these\nemotions onto the chest and neck area. These body maps were then used as a basis for plac-\ning haptic actuators during the on-body prototyping sessions. Additionally, participants were\nguided through embodied metaphor elicitation, where metaphors linked to their objects (e.g.,\n”soft but supportive”) were translated into vibration patterns."}

{"doc_id": "Vincent_Master_Thesis0225.pdf", "page": 62, "text": "3\nMETHODOLOGY\n49\nEmbodied Metaphor Elicitation and Emotional Object Sharing\nThis initial activity cen-\nters around the participants’ objects that they were asked to bring for the workshop. The objects\nare meant to evoke specific emotions, which participants will use to inform their haptic design\nprocess. The sharing of these objects and the emotions attached to them acts as an icebreaker\nand a bridge into a more focused reflection on emotional design.\n• Object Introduction Round: Participants are introduced to the concept of embodied\nmetaphors. They are then asked to present their objects, explaining the personal emotional\nconnection they have to them. Each participant shares why the object is significant, what\nemotions it evokes, and how the physical properties of the object relate to those emotions.\nThis round is recorded and later transcribed to ensure that participants can refer back to\ntheir insights during the design process. This exercise also helps participants articulate\nemotional experiences, creating a shared understanding within the group and preparing\nthem for deeper emotional exploration. The introduction serves to reinforce the role of\nmetaphor in translating abstract emotions into tangible design elements [5, 39].\n• Exploring Emotional Metaphors: After introducing their objects, participants are asked\nto reflect on and document the sensory qualities of their object, considering its emotional\nimpact and the metaphors that can be drawn from its physical characteristics. For exam-\nple, if a participant brought a soft blanket associated with comfort, they may describe the\nblanket’s warmth and softness as metaphors for the feeling of emotional security. These\nreflections are shared with their Tandem Design partners to foster understanding and em-\npathy in preparation for the prototyping phase. The discussions help participants develop\nearly ideas about how to translate these emotional experiences into haptic sensations.\nThe purpose of this activity is to provide participants with a framework for thinking about\nhow everyday objects can be imbued with emotional meaning. The process of discussing and\ndocumenting these emotions lays the groundwork for the more technical and physical elements\nof the workshop. For further details, please refer to section 4.\nBody Mapping for Emotional Baseline (5 Minutes)\nBuilding on the insights from the metaphor\nelicitation exercise, participants are introduced to body mapping, a technique often used in\nsoma-based design, to document how emotions are experienced physically. Participants use\nbody maps to represent where they feel specific emotions in their bodies visually. This step\naims to create an emotional baseline for each participant, guiding haptic feedback design later\nin the workshop.\n• Introduction to Body Mapping: Participants are shown a series of slides that explain\nhow body maps are used to document the location and intensity of emotions felt within\nthe body. The introduction highlights differences in sensitivity across different body parts,\ndrawing attention to how certain areas like the hands, feet, and face are more sensitive\nto tactile feedback than the back or limbs. This understanding helps participants make\ninformed decisions later about where to place haptic feedback actuators on the body."}
{"doc_id": "Vincent_Master_Thesis0225.pdf", "page": 63, "text": "3\nMETHODOLOGY\n50\n• Activity Instructions: Participants are given templates of male and female body maps,\nand instructed to mark areas of the body where they feel specific emotions associated\nwith the object they discussed. They are encouraged to annotate the body map with\ncolors, symbols, and descriptions that help convey the intensity and type of sensation\n(e.g., warmth, tightness, relaxation). They are also encouraged to document both the\nfront and back of the body, noting any asymmetries in how the emotion is experienced\nacross these areas.\n• Guiding Questions for Body Mapping: To support the body mapping process, partici-\npants are provided with a set of guiding questions. These questions prompt participants\nto reflect on the intensity and quality of the emotion, asking them to rate sensations on a\nscale from 1 to 10, describe how the emotion manifests physically, and consider whether\ncertain contexts or triggers intensify the sensations. Participants are also asked to think\nabout how they might translate these sensations into haptic feedback. These questions en-\ncourage participants to internalize their emotional responses and connect these responses\nwith tangible design concepts.\nDocumentation of Ideas for the Prototyping Session (20 Minutes)\nAfter introducing the\nbody mapping exercise, participants started internalizing and creating body maps to document\ntheir emotional and sensory reflections in preparation for the upcoming prototyping session.\nThey were instructed to also fill out the embodied metaphor elicitation template provided on\ntheir dedicated workspace. This documentation process helps them solidify their thoughts and\nprepare for collaboration with their Tandem Design partners.\n• Use of Embodied Metaphor Elicitation Workspace: Participants use a pre-designed\nworkspace to document their object and associated emotions. This workspace includes\nthe Circumplex Model of Affect and the Emotion Typology to help participants simplify\nthe emotional experience into valence and arousal dimensions. They are also encouraged\nto take photographs of their object and include descriptive notes that will serve as a refer-\nence point during the prototyping process. The worksheet asks participants to reflect on\nthe emotional experience of interacting with their object and begin to ideate on potential\nhaptic feedback mechanisms that could evoke similar emotions.\n3.2.6\nPhase 3: Prototyping Sessions - 2x 45 Minutes\nThe third phase of the workshop centered on the practical implementation of the theoretical and\nconceptual knowledge participants had gathered in the first two phases. During this phase, the\nHapticlabs DevKit and previously created body maps and embodied metaphors were used to\nfoster Lo-Fi, on-body affective haptic prototype design processes.\nParticipants were encouraged to engage in an iterative design process, where they would alter-\nnate between creating, testing, and refining their haptic feedback prototypes.

This setup provided opportunities for both participants to contribute to the design pro-\ncess while experiencing the affective haptic feedback as intended for their partner’s emotional\nobject.\nHapticlabs DevKit Setup and Exploration (10 Minutes)\nThe workshop started with partic-\nipants setting up and exploring the Hapticlabs DevKit. This toolkit includes three actuators —\nERM (Eccentric Rotating Mass), LRA (Linear Resonant Actuator), and Piezoelectric actuators\n— which are capable of generating various haptic feedback patterns.\nERM Actuators are simple, cost-effective components with limited control over feedback in-\ntensity but capable of creating strong vibrations.\nLRA Actuators are more precise, offering responsive and complex vibrations, often used for\nmore intricate haptic designs.\nPiezoelectric Actuators offer the highest precision and fastest response but are more complex\nand expensive, allowing for high-fidelity prototyping.\nParticipants were asked to download and install the Hapticlabs software on their laptops prior\nto the workshop. Each group was provided with unique activation codes to enable them to use\nthe software for prototyping purposes. Once the software was set up, participants connected the\nHapticlabs satellite kit via USB and started exploring the functionality of the actuators through\nthe software interface.\nThe setup allowed participants to adjust the following:\nIntensity: Control over the strength of the feedback.\nFrequency: Manipulation of how fast or slow the vibrations are produced.\nPatterns: Participants could explore pre-programmed or customized vibration sequences, or\ncreate their own from scratch using the Hapticlabs Studio software with the Hapticlabs DevKit\nconnected.\nThey were encouraged to experiment and familiarize themselves with the Hapticlabs DevKit\nand Hapticlabs Studio software, preparing them for the more detailed prototyping work to fol-\nlow. This exploration phase helped them choose the appropriate actuator for their affective\nhaptic feedback design.\nPairing Up and Prototyping Cheatsheet (5 Minutes)\nOnce participants were familiar with\nthe Hapticlabs DevKit, they were paired up with their tandem partner from earlier phases. Be-\nfore diving into prototyping, they received a “Prototyping Cheatsheet” as a guideline, which\nreiterated key concepts to keep in mind during the prototyping sessions:\nUser-Centered Design: Focus on the emotional experience of the user, continuously gathering\nand incorporating feedback into the design.\nExperience Prototyping: Roleplaying the interaction context to think about nuances and UXs.\nParticipants were advised to keep their prototypes simple and focus on the conceptual ideas."}

Participants engaged\nin two 45-minute prototyping sessions, during which they used the methodological toolkit and\nHapticlabs DevKit to design and iterate on haptic feedback patterns based on their body maps\nand metaphor elicitation exercises. The workshop provided a limited set of actuators, which\nparticipants were encouraged to explore while iterating on their designs. Each round lasted 45\nminutes, and roles were switched after the first round to give both participants the chance to\ntake the perspective of both the designer and the user.\nPrototyping Round One\nRole Assignment:\nParticipant 1 took on the role of the User(U) and was testing and evaluating the haptic prototype.\nParticipant 2 took on the role of the Designer(D), developed the haptic feedback patterns, and\ndiscussed where actuator placement would be suitable.\nUser Role (Participant 1): The U tested the haptic prototype on the body, shared their embod-\nied metaphor elicitation sheet with the D to start the ideation process, and provided real-time\nfeedback. This feedback involved talking through their experiences, filling out body maps, and\nreflecting on how well the haptic feedback aligned with the affective impact of their emotional\nobject.\nDesigner Role (Participant 2): The D developed AHFD using the Hapticlabs software and\nHapticlabs DevKit. They attached actuators to specific locations on the U’s body (as identified\nin the body map) and asked open-ended questions to gather more detailed feedback from the U.\nDocumentation and Iteration: Both participants were encouraged to document their process\nthrough Miro, taking photos, making voice recordings, and filling out notes and body maps.\nThe D would iterate on the feedback patterns based on the U’s reactions, continuously refining\nthe prototype."}

This switch allowed\nboth participants to engage fully in the creative and experiential aspects of prototyping.\nFeedback Loop and Documentation: Throughout both rounds, participants continued iterat-\ning on their designs and documented their process using the tools provided. They uploaded\nphotos, notes, and screenshots of their work into the Miro workspace.\nDocumentation and Reflection (10 Minutes)\nAfter completing both prototyping rounds,\nparticipants were reminded to upload their design documentation, including their notes, photos,\nvideos, and completed body maps, into the shared workspace. They were also asked to engage\nin a brief recorded discussion with their tandem partner to reflect on their experiences during\nthe prototyping sessions.\nParticipants discussed the challenges they encountered, the insights they gained from their part-\nner’s feedback, and any potential improvements for their designs. This reflection session aimed\nto solidify their learning and prepare them for the next steps in refining their prototypes.\nCreate: Design and prototype Lo-Fi, on-body AHFS.\nDocument: Capture the design process, challenges, and outcomes using the provided templates\nand personal documentation.\nDiscuss & Reflect: Gather insights, iterate on the prototype, and prepare for further refinement\nof the affective haptic feedback design.\nThis methodology phase ensured that participants were able to fully engage with the practical\nelements of affective on-body haptic prototyping.

This phase involved two key activities: a final individually written quantitative survey\nand a final group discussion with six guiding questions.

{"doc_id": "Vincent_Master_Thesis0225.pdf", "page": 67, "text": "3\nMETHODOLOGY\n54\nIndividual Survey:\nThe individual survey included open-ended questions to capture partici-\npants’ personal reflections on various aspects of the workshop, including the methodologies in-\ntroduced and their experience with haptic feedback design. The survey questions were designed\nto provide insights into how the participants understood and applied the toolkit, as well as the\nemotional frameworks (such as the Circumplex Model of Affect and embodied metaphors) that\nunderpinned the design process. The survey included the following sections:\n• General Usefulness: This section asked participants to reflect on the overall usefulness\nof the workshop in helping them understand and apply haptic feedback in their designs.\nIt explored which parts of the workshop were most beneficial and which were potentially\nchallenging. This section directly relates to evaluating the toolkit’s usefulness in fostering\na comprehensive understanding of haptic design for novice interaction designers.\n• Body Maps and Embodied Metaphors: These questions explored how participants used\nbody maps and embodied metaphor elicitation in their design process. For example,\nparticipants were asked how useful they found the body maps in guiding their haptic\ndesign and whether they would use this methodology again. This data helps to assess\nthe hypothesis that body mapping and embodied metaphor elicitation can be useful for\nnovice interaction designers to translate emotional experiences into tactile feedback.\n• Prototyping and Toolkit Usage: Participants were asked about the challenges they faced\nduring the prototyping phase and how well the haptic feedback aligned with the emotions\nthey intended to evoke. They were also asked to provide recommendations for improving\nthe toolkit and suggest additional materials that could enhance the workshop experience.\nThis section aimed to gather insights into the technical aspects of the toolkit, its acces-\nsibility, and its ease of use for novice interaction designers, aligning with the research\nquestion about the toolkit’s usefulness.\nGroup Discussion:\nFollowing the individual survey, a group discussion was held to promote\nreflective thinking and to allow participants to share their experiences, insights, and challenges\nopenly. The discussion was semi-structured, with guiding questions presented to steer the con-\nversation toward specific aspects of the workshop. The group discussion was designed to en-\ncourage participants to think critically about the usefulness of the toolkit, the process of embod-\nied metaphor elicitation, and their collaborative prototyping experience.\nThe discussion was framed around two core themes:\n• Insights and Challenges: Participants were asked how the prototyping sessions helped\nthem understand the emotional impact of their designs and whether the embodied metaphor\nexercises aided their emotional translation into haptic feedback.

This was done to put their input into context for the reader and\ndraw conclusions for intersections of feedback throughout different professional back-\ngrounds.\n3.2.9\nSummary\nThe workshop was meticulously structured to guide participants through the intricate process\nof affective haptic design, blending theoretical frameworks with hands-on, on-body prototyping\nactivities to facilitate comprehensive learning. The session commenced with an introduction to\nEmotion Typology, a project developed by TU Delft, which categorizes emotions into posi-\ntive and negative dimensions. Participants were instructed to lean towards positive emotions;\nhowever, the initial exercise invited them to express how they were feeling on the day of the\nworkshop. This exercise was supported by an interactive website featuring detailed information\ncards for each emotion, including relatable scenarios, example movie clips, visual represen-\ntations, and typical expressions. This resource proved particularly beneficial for non-native\nEnglish speakers, as it provided accessible descriptions and context, aiding in the accurate ar-\nticulation of complex emotions.\nSubsequently, the workshop delved into the Circumplex Model of Affect, which maps emotions\nalong two axes: valence (unpleasant to pleasant) and arousal (activation to deactivation). Partic-\nipants were guided to distill their complex emotions into this model, simplifying their emotional\nlandscape into manageable categories. This reduction facilitated a clearer understanding of how\nspecific emotions could be translated into haptic feedback patterns. Following this, an activity\nfocused on real-life applications of haptics encouraged participants to brainstorm various sce-\nnarios where tactile feedback could enhance UXs. This exercise broadened their perception of\nhaptic design possibilities and underscored the versatility of haptic feedback in different con-\ntexts.\nA pivotal component of the workshop was the embodied metaphor elicitation exercise. Partici-\npants were prompted to associate their emotionally significant objects with bodily experiences,\ntranslating abstract emotions into tangible design elements. For example, a participant who\nassociated a basketball toy with feelings of calmness designed a haptic pattern mimicking the\nrhythmic motion of dribbling. This methodology emphasized the importance of metaphors\ngrounded in physical experiences, enabling participants to create more nuanced and emotion-\nally affective haptic feedback.\nThe body maps activity further reinforced this translation process. Participants were provided\nwith pre-printed body map templates and instructed to denote areas of their bodies that corre-"}

Guidelines included the use of colors\nand symbols to represent different emotions and areas of emotional sensitivity. Additionally,\nreferences to skin sensitivity across various body parts informed participants about the appropri-\nate placement of haptic actuators. Guiding questions facilitated reflection on emotional zones,\nintensity, and temporal dynamics, enabling participants to make informed decisions about where\nand how to apply haptic feedback to evoke desired emotional responses.\nThe workshop culminated in Tandem Design prototyping sessions, where participants were di-\nvided into pairs and alternated between the roles of designer and user. Equipped with Haptic\nLabs hardware kits and access to specialized software, participants engaged in low-fidelity on-\nbody prototyping, iteratively designing and refining haptic feedback patterns based on real-time\nuser feedback. This hands-on approach emphasized user-centered design principles, encourag-\ning collaborative problem-solving and immediate iteration to enhance the emotional impact of\ntheir designs.\n4\nResults\nThis section presents the comprehensive findings from the workshop, detailing the participants’\ndemographic background, their engagement with the proposed methodological toolkit in the key\nactivities, and the overall impact of the different phases of the workshop. It includes a detailed\nexploration of participants’ feedback, emotional articulation, and technical experiences with\nhaptic design. These findings directly address the research questions in section 1.4 and provide\nthe groundwork for the subsequent discussion of the effectiveness, challenges, and areas for\nimprovement in the single-modal affective haptic workshop.\n4.1\nParticipant Demographics and Initial Survey Results\nIn the following findings from the initial surveys in phase 1 (3.2.4), the outcomes of the work-\nshop, and the qualitative feedback provided by the participants is presented.\nThe initial survey at the end of phase 1 3.2.4 aimed to collect comprehensive demographic\ndata, assess participants’ prior experience with haptic design and related methodologies, and\nunderstand their expectations and qualitative feedback for the workshop structure. This baseline\ninformation was crucial for meaningfully interpreting the qualitative feedback. Knowing the\nparticipants’ backgrounds made it possible to propose changes to the workshop structure and\ntoolkit usage to the broad range of novice interaction designers and researchers’ needs.\nTaking the participants backgrounds into consideration gives a detailed correlation between\ntheir prior knowledge and feedback on the toolkit’s perceived usefulness in teaching the nu-\nances of affective haptic feedback design. This complex interdisciplinary field should be made\naccessible to novice interaction designers coming from a range of research fields described in\nparagraph 2.6."}

Pros of this constella-\ntion include a strong foundational knowledge in HCI and related disciplines, as evidenced by all\nparticipants holding or pursuing master’s degrees in fields such as HCI, Multimedia Technology,\nIndustrial Product Design, Psychology, UX Design, and Digital Concept Development. As the\nRQ1 1.4 This academic diversity fosters a rich interdisciplinary environment, encouraging the\nexchange of varied perspectives and fostering innovative approaches to affective haptic design.\nAdditionally, the presence of participants with moderate experience in haptic prototyping and\ndesign (e.g., AP1, BP1, CP1) provides a balanced mix of novices and those with some practical\nexposure, facilitating peer learning and mentorship within Tandem Design groups. The varied\nprofessional roles, ranging from Industrial Designers and Interaction Designers to Senior Appli-\ncation Developers and UX/UI Designers, further enhance the collaborative potential, allowing\nparticipants to leverage their specific expertise to support each other’s learning processes.\nHowever, there are notable cons associated with this participant constellation. The small sam-\nple size of six limits the generalizability of the findings, as it may not capture the full spectrum\nof novice interaction designers’ experiences and challenges. Moreover, the group exhibits sig-\nnificant variability in familiarity with key skills pertinent to the workshop, such as embodied\nmetaphors, body maps, and affective haptic design, with most participants rating their familiar-\nity as low to moderate. This disparity necessitates a highly adaptable workshop structure to cater\nto both relatively experienced individuals and complete beginners, potentially diluting the focus"}

Additionally, the limited prior experience in affective haptic\ndesign and on-body prototyping among the majority highlights a steep learning curve, which\ncould lead to uneven engagement and varying levels of success in applying the methodologies\nintroduced. Technical proficiency also varied, particularly in coding skills, where only one\nparticipant (AP2) reported high proficiency, while others rated themselves significantly lower.\nThis uneven distribution of technical skills underscores the importance of providing compre-\nhensive, beginner-friendly tools and extensive support to ensure all participants can effectively\nengage with the prototyping toolkit. Furthermore, the homogeneity in educational backgrounds,\npredominantly rooted in HCI and design, may inadvertently narrow the range of emotional in-\nterpretations and design approaches, potentially overlooking insights from other relevant fields\nsuch as cognitive psychology or cultural studies. Lastly, the emotional objects brought by par-\nticipants, while personally significant, were uniformly positive, which may limit the exploration\nof a broader emotional spectrum in haptic design applications.\nIn summary, the participant constellation presents a balanced mix of academic and profes-\nsional backgrounds that enrich the collaborative environment and foster interdisciplinary learn-\ning. However, the small and somewhat homogeneous sample size, coupled with significant\nvariability in prior experience and technical skills, introduces challenges in ensuring equitable\nengagement and comprehensive skill development. Addressing these cons through tailored in-\nstructional support, diversified participant recruitment, and enhanced toolkit features will be\nessential in future iterations to maximize the effectiveness and inclusivity of the workshop.\n4.2\nKey Activities\nIn order to understand the feedback given by the participants, the workshop activities and their\ncontributed work have to be mentioned and explained. In the following paragraphs the emo-\ntional connection and usage of methodologies of each participant is explained in detail.\nRemarks\nThe iterative nature of the prototyping sessions was designed to allow for smooth\ntransitions between phases, encouraging participants to refine their designs based on real-time\nfeedback. However, in practice, these transitions were not always as fluid as anticipated. Tech-\nnical issues, such as limited haptic actuators and challenges in understanding the functionality of\nthe hardware, frequently interrupted the flow of the workshop. For instance, BP2 and AP1 both\nexpressed frustration with the limitations of the provided tools, noting that the lack of diversity\nin haptic actuators constrained their creative output. Moreover, participants struggled with the\npractical application of the haptic toolkit, particularly in translating abstract emotional concepts\ninto effective haptic feedback. While some, like BP1, found success in prototyping simple,\nrepetitive patterns, others, like CP2, faced obstacles in generating more complex emotional rep-\nresentations. This disparity in outcomes indicates that the current iteration of the toolkit may\nrequire further refinement, particularly in terms of offering more technical guidance and time or\npre-workshop preparation for the participants and expanding the range of haptic tools available.\nThese findings suggest that while the iterative design approach holds promise, it must be sup-\nported by more robust technical frameworks and clearer instructional support to ensure a more"}

However, they sometimes struggled more with the creative\naspects of translating emotions into haptic feedback.\n• Participants with less technical experience but a stronger background in emotional design\nor UX found the creative exercises, such as embodied metaphor elicitation, to be more\nintuitive. They excelled in designing prototypes that were emotionally affective, even if\nthey required more support with the technical setup.\nRole of Collaboration in Learning:\n• The tandem approach facilitated peer learning, particularly for participants who were less\nconfident in certain areas. For example, participants with stronger coding skills were able\nto assist their partners with the technical setup, while those with a better understanding of\nemotional design helped translate these concepts into haptic feedback.\n• Collaboration also helped participants overcome anticipated challenges by pooling their\nknowledge and skills, which was crucial in creating useful, educative affective haptic\nprototypes within the limited workshop timeframe.\nUsefulness of the Hapticlabs DevKit in Meeting Expectations:\n• Overall, the toolkit was well-received in terms of its usability and educational value in\nhelping participants achieve their learning objectives.

{"doc_id": "Vincent_Master_Thesis0225.pdf", "page": 116, "text": "4\nRESULTS\n103\n4.3\nImpact of Emotion Typology and Circumplex Model Introduction\n4.3.1\nStructured Emotional Articulation\nThe introduction of Emotion Typology and the Circumplex Model of Affect was one of the\nmost impactful elements of the workshop. These frameworks helped participants articulate\nand categorize complex emotions associated with their personal objects, which was particularly\nvaluable in the context of having non-native English speakers as participants but executing the\nworkshop in English. BP2, for example, expressed that the structured approach expanded their\nemotional vocabulary, making it easier to convey nuanced feelings through their designs:\n”What I really liked was that you in the beginning brought in the scope of, for me,\nemotions and how these are called or how they feel because... it would be hard to\ncome up with the description that I came up with without looking at the emotions\nthat you presented us today.”\nThis sentiment was echoed by AP2, who noted the value of clear emotional frameworks:\n”I also thought the basis of the emotions was very nice because I also hadn’t had\nsome of these words or emotions that clear.”\n4.3.2\nVisual Representation and Emotional Scope\nThe visual tools provided as part of the Emotion Typology allowed participants to visualize\nand articulate their emotional states more effectively. The circumplex model’s division of emo-\ntions into dimensions such as valence and arousal provided a structured means to explore how\nspecific emotions could be translated into haptic sensations. Participants reported that these\nresources enabled them to connect the abstract concept of emotion with physical sensations and\nsubsequently into haptic feedback design.\nHowever, while the typology was beneficial, some participants noted that the range of emotions\npresented was somewhat limited. For example, participants generally brought objects associ-\nated with positive emotions, which might have restricted the exploration of a broader emotional\nspectrum.\n4.4\nUsefulness of Embodied Metaphors and Body Maps\nThe workshop outcomes were assessed based on the usefulness of the toolkit in aiding partic-\nipants in designing affective haptic feedback prototypes. The analysis focuses on how partici-\npants used body maps and embodied metaphors to translate emotions into haptic feedback, as\nwell as the overall success of the prototyping sessions."}
{"doc_id": "Vincent_Master_Thesis0225.pdf", "page": 117, "text": "4\nRESULTS\n104\nBody Maps\nParticipants used body maps to visually represent the areas of the body where\nthey believed haptic feedback would be most effective in conveying specific emotions. The\nuse of body maps proved instrumental in helping participants conceptualize the placement and\nimpact of haptic actuators on the body. As explained in section 4.2.\nParticipants found body mapping to be beneficial in recognizing, reflecting, and connecting\nemotions to specific body parts. AP1 stated, “I agree with the whole method of body maps\nhelping to understand the emotion and where I feel it, and you can just become more aware\nof your own body.” However, they faced challenges when attempting to directly translate these\nemotional locations into actuator placements during prototyping. AP1 noted, “When it comes\nto translating now this body map to the haptic design, I think it’s sometimes not really straight-\nforward or that obvious that if you experience something in your chest or in your head, then you\nshould use the actuators in that place.” Specifically, placing actuators on emotionally significant\nareas like the chest created discomfort: “Some places that are being emotionally influenced\n(like chest, for example) shouldn’t be externally stimulated with vibrations because it creates a\nweird, eerie feeling.” This feedback highlights that while body maps are useful for understand-\ning emotional experiences, designers must carefully consider the appropriateness and comfort\nof actuator placement, rather than relying solely on the locations identified in the body maps.\nWith AP1 noting that placing actuators on emotionally significant areas, like the chest, created\nan ”eerie feeling”, specifically when placed around the heart, it emphasises the importance\nof carefully selection of the appropriate area of haptic affect through vibrotactile stimulation.\nBP1 also highlighted how ”the same vibration pattern on the chest and back created different\nemotional responses” demonstrating the importance of body maps in refining the placement of\nhaptic actuators to better align with emotional intentions.\nAP1 stated,\n”I agree with the whole method of body maps helping to understand the emotion\nand where I feel it and you can just become more aware of your own body. When\nyou recall a memory for example you recall your attitude towards an object.”\naligning with the intent of RQ11.4 of investigating the impact of body maps and embodied\nmetaphor elicitation on the design and communication process of haptic feedback.\nYet, AP1 criticises:\n”But when it comes to translating now this body map to the haptic design, I think it’s\nsometimes not really straightforward or that obvious that if you experience some-\nthing in your chest or in your head then you should use the actuators in that place or\nyou use the vibration in that place. Because it’s one thing to have this feeling com-\ning from the inside just naturally and just recording it and then it’s another thing to\nprovoke it with the external stimulator or the trigger.\nEven though AP1 did not find it useful to translate the location of felt emotion directly into the\nsuitable location for the haptic prototype to induce the emotion, the participant further stated,"}
{"doc_id": "Vincent_Master_Thesis0225.pdf", "page": 118, "text": "4\nRESULTS\n105\n”I liked that it gave me an initial idea of where I can place the actuators, although\nplacing them on emotionally charged areas like the chest created a strange, eerie\nfeeling”\nSimilarly, Participant BP1 appreciated the maps for visualizing how haptic feedback could be\ndesigned across different parts of the body, remarking that\n”using body maps enabled me to also see my options, and having the same pattern\non the chest and back creates different experiences.”\nThis feedback illustrates the value of body maps as a design tool but also reveals limitations,\nsuch as difficulties in translating abstract emotional experiences into physical stimuli. The feed-\nback was mixed regarding their overall effectiveness. While some participants, like CP1, found\nbody maps useful for organizing emotions, others, such as CP2, struggled to translate these\nemotional representations into effective haptic feedback. While body mapping can be a helpful\nreflective tool, its role in aiding the haptic design process may require further refinement or\nadditional support to be fully effective. While the tool provided an entry point for this explo-\nration, the process was not universally straightforward for all participants. Feedback revealed\na significant variability in how participants engaged with body mapping. Participants, such as\nCP1 and BP3, found it useful for organizing their thoughts and guiding the prototyping process.\nOthers, like CP2, reported difficulty in converting the abstract emotions identified on their body\nmaps into actionable haptic feedback. This highlights that while body mapping can serve as a\nvaluable reflective exercise, it may require additional support, iteration, or simply more time for\ninternalization (i.e. the body mapping activity) to bridge the gap between the conceptual and\nthe practical application of haptic design. The varying levels of success observed with body\nmapping suggest that it may function more as a starting point for emotional reflection, rather\nthan a comprehensive solution for translating emotional states into tactile outputs.\n• Emotional Localization: Participants successfully identified and targeted specific areas\nof the body that corresponded with the emotional states they aimed to evoke. For example,\nfeedback associated with stress relief was often applied to areas such as the shoulders or\nback, while feedback intended to evoke excitement was focused on areas like the chest or\nhands.\n• Design Precision: The use of body maps allowed participants to refine their designs with\ngreater precision, ensuring that the haptic feedback was not only conceptually aligned\nwith the intended emotion tied to the brought object but also physically effective in deliv-\nering that UX.\nEmbodied Metaphors:\nThe embodied metaphor elicitation exercise played a crucial role in\nhelping participants translate abstract emotional concepts into tangible haptic designs."}
{"doc_id": "Vincent_Master_Thesis0225.pdf", "page": 119, "text": "4\nRESULTS\n106\n• Metaphor Application: Participants were able to create haptic feedback patterns that\nreflected the metaphors they had chosen. For instance, one participant associated the\nfeeling of calmness with the metaphor of ”waves on a beach,” leading them to design a\nrhythmic, pulsing feedback that mimicked the sensation of waves gently rolling over the\nbody.\n• Emotional Resonance: The metaphors helped participants connect emotionally with\ntheir designs, resulting in feedback patterns that were not only technically sound but also\nresonant with the desired emotional experience.\nParticipants, such as BP2, successfully utilized metaphors to translate their emotional connec-\ntion with objects. For instance, BP2 described the metaphor of “confidence as an upright pos-\nture” and mapped this to vibrations along the upper body to reflect their emotional experience.\nBP2 explained in the individual survey,\n“The necklace of [BP1] represents a kind of confidence that we connected with\nposture. An upright posture has some kind of interoceptive elements (the internal\nlived experience, feeling your own body). We tried approaching this by introduc-\ning a stimulating trigger through vibration that ‘travels’ and connects with certain\nmuscles that are involved when you stand upright.”\nThis use of metaphors guided the translation of abstract emotions into concrete designs. The\nprototype illustrating this concept is shown in Figure 47. The next section will explore how\nthese metaphors informed design choices and their emotional affect on the participants.\n4.4.1\nFacilitating Emotional Translation\nEmbodied metaphors and body maps were introduced to help participants translate abstract\nemotions into tangible haptic feedback. This process grounded emotional experiences in phys-\nical sensations and participants explored the spatial and metaphorical dimensions of their ob-\nject’s emotions. For example, BP1 used the metaphor of a basketball dribble to evoke a feeling\nof calmness, successfully incorporating this metaphor into the design of haptic feedback pat-\nterns. CP1 similarly reflected on the usefulness of body maps in directing their design:\n”I found the body map particularly useful in figuring out where I associate spe-\ncific emotions. It gave me a clearer direction on where to start applying the haptic\nfeedback designs.”\n4.4.2\nEnhancing Communication Between Designers and Users\nThe Tandem Design setup, in which participants alternated between the roles of designer and\nuser, coupled with embodied metaphors and body maps, significantly enhanced communication.\nParticipants found that by discussing their personal emotional experiences, they were better able\nto translate and fine-tune haptic feedback to resonate with their design partner. BP2 emphasized\nthe importance of communication in the design process, stating,"}
{"doc_id": "Vincent_Master_Thesis0225.pdf", "page": 120, "text": "4\nRESULTS\n107\n”Through communication, I felt like it was way better that we expressed the first-\nperson felt experience. So we had to communicate inside out what we felt.”\n4.4.3\nChallenges in Translating Complex Metaphors\nDespite the usefulness of embodied metaphors, some participants struggled with translating\nmore complex or abstract metaphors into haptic feedback. AP2 observed:\n”I feel like this method can work well if you have a metaphor that can be translated\neasily into haptics, but... the more complex the initial embodied metaphor, the\nharder it is to translate.”\nAP1 also noted that certain body map locations, such as the chest, were difficult to stimulate\ncomfortably with vibrations, raising the issue of user discomfort in specific body areas:\n”Some places that are being emotionally influenced (like chest, for example) shouldn’t\nbe externally stimulated with vibrations because it creates a weird, eerie feeling.”\nThese challenges highlighted the need for further refinement in how embodied metaphors and\nbody maps are utilized, especially when dealing with complex emotional states and sensitive\nbody areas.\n4.5\nChallenges Faced During Prototyping Sessions\nTandem On-Body Prototyping Sessions\nThe iterative nature of the prototyping sessions al-\nlowed participants to test, refine, and improve their designs based on real-time feedback from\ntheir partners. BP1 emphasized the benefits of this approach:\n“With some iterations, we managed to create the feeling we went for.”\nHowever, participants also faced challenges due to technical limitations and the subjective na-\nture of emotional interpretation. BP2 highlighted the importance of communication in this\nprocess:\n“Through communication, I felt like it was way better that we expressed the first-\nperson felt experience. So we had to communicate inside out what we felt.”\nThis underscores that while iterative prototyping and collaboration are valuable, they require ef-\nfective communication and may be hindered by individual differences and technical constraints."}
{"doc_id": "Vincent_Master_Thesis0225.pdf", "page": 121, "text": "4\nRESULTS\n108\n• Iterative Real-Time On-Body Design Process: Participants engaged in continuous test-\ning and refinement of their affective haptic on-body prototypes, using feedback from their\npartners to make adjustments. The iterative nature of the prototyping sessions allowed\nparticipants to refine their designs. For example, BP2 highlighted how the trial-and-error\napproach of their body-storming helped them explore first-person emotional experiences,\nmaking the process of designing haptic feedback more tangible and meaningful in real-\ntime. This process was critical in helping them understand the nuances of single-modal\naffective haptic feedback and how small changes could significantly impact the emotional\nexperience.\n• Successful Outcomes: By the end of the workshop, all participants managed to develop\nand test affective haptic feedback that resembled their personal object’s emotion. The\nideation and Lo-Fi on-body prototyping for achieving the subjective emotional affect\nsuccessfully resembled the intended emotional trigger. These outcomes demonstrated the\ntoolkit’s ability to support novice interaction designers in creating emotionally affective\nhaptic feedback, even with minimal prior experience.\n4.5.1\nTechnical Complexity and Learning Curve\nOne of the main challenges participants encountered was the technical complexity of on-body\nhaptic design. For example, CP1 experienced connectivity issues with the hardware, stating,\n”Bluetooth connection was very bad and hindered the process.”\nWhile most participants found the hardware (Hapticlabs DevKit) relatively easy to connect, the\nsoftware interface still presented some struggles in its intuitive usage.\nWhile participants found the hardware straightforward to connect, they faced challenges with\nthe software interface.\nBP1 expressed frustration with the learning curve associated with the Hapticlabs Studio soft-\nware:\n”Understanding the software was a bit challenging; the hardware is very straight-\nforward to connect... The software wasn’t very intuitive... The interface could be\nmore user-friendly.”\nSpecific issues included difficulty in navigating the interface and a lack of guidance on the\neffective integration of pre-built haptic patterns.\nThis difficulty was exacerbated for participants with lower coding skills, further emphasizing\nthe need for more intuitive, beginner-friendly software for novice interaction designers."}
{"doc_id": "Vincent_Master_Thesis0225.pdf", "page": 122, "text": "4\nRESULTS\n109\n4.5.2\nSubjectivity of Emotional Interpretation\nThe subjective nature of emotional interpretation presented another significant challenge. Par-\nticipants found that designing for affective experiences was inherently difficult because emo-\ntions are experienced differently by different individuals. BP2 remarked:\n”It was his really subjective feeling that I tried to resemble and implement... we had\nto give feedback to each other and communicate really well what we were trying to\ndo.”\nThis difficulty in achieving universal emotional resonance through haptic feedback was a re-\ncurrent theme, highlighting the importance of communication and iterative feedback during the\nprototyping process.\n4.6\nTechnical Limitations of the Toolkit\n4.6.1\nHardware Constraints\nParticipants encountered several hardware limitations during the prototyping sessions, which\nimpacted their ability to fully explore haptic designs. The Hapticlabs DevKit’s Bluetooth con-\nnectivity issues and the limited number of actuators were particularly frustrating for partici-\npants. CP1 noted:\n”Hardware challenges: Bluetooth connection was very bad and hindered the pro-\ncess... wire connection didn’t work.”\nBP2 expressed concern over the narrow range of actuator options:\n”Only having two actuators was difficult because they unfolded their impact only\nlocally.”\nAP1 noted a limitation in prototyping spatial haptic experiences due to the availability of only\none actuator of each type:\n”Can’t prototype spatially, only one actuator of one type.”\nThis constraint hindered the ability to create more complex, multi-point haptic feedback pat-\nterns.\nThese hardware constraints limited the spatial and dynamic variety of haptic feedback that par-\nticipants could create, restricting their creative potential and exploration of more complex emo-\ntional designs."}
{"doc_id": "Vincent_Master_Thesis0225.pdf", "page": 123, "text": "4\nRESULTS\n110\n4.6.2\nSoftware Usability Issues\nParticipants also struggled with the software’s usability, which was not as intuitive as expected.\nBP1 mentioned:\n”The software wasn’t very intuitive... The interface could be more user-friendly.”\nThis issue hindered some participants’ ability to experiment freely and iterate on their designs,\nunderscoring the need for improved software that caters to novice users, offering clear instruc-\ntions, pre-designed haptic patterns, and more intuitive controls.\n4.7\nParticipant Feedback and Recommendations\n4.7.1\nPositive Feedback\nParticipants appreciated several aspects of the workshop and the toolkit. The introduction of\nthe Emotion Typology, the collaborative Tandem Design approach, and the hands-on nature of\nthe activities were frequently cited as strengths of the workshop. Participants appreciated the\nhands-on activities and collaborative environment of the workshop. CP2 commented:\n”They were great! Much needed to have a detailed overview of the design process...\nThis setup provided an opportunity to do so and freedom to do it the way you wish\nas a designer.”\nQualitative feedback from participants provided valuable insights into their experiences with\nthe toolkit and the overall workshop structure. This section summarizes the key themes that\nemerged from the feedback, highlighting both the strengths of the workshop and areas for po-\ntential improvement.\n• Toolkit Usability: Participants praised the user-friendliness of the toolkit, particularly\nthe Hapticlabs hardware and software. They found the interface intuitive and appreciated\nthe clear instructions provided for setting up and using the actuators.\n• Collaborative Learning: The tandem approach was well-received, with participants not-\ning that working in pairs allowed them to exchange ideas, provide mutual support, and\nlearn from each other’s experiences. This collaborative environment was seen as a key\nfactor in the success of the workshop.\n• Creative Freedom: Participants valued the creative freedom afforded by the workshop\nstructure, which encouraged them to experiment with different designs and iterate based\non feedback. They appreciated the balance between guidance and autonomy, which al-\nlowed them to explore their ideas while still receiving support when needed."}
{"doc_id": "Vincent_Master_Thesis0225.pdf", "page": 124, "text": "4\nRESULTS\n111\n4.7.2\nAreas for Improvement:\nParticipants suggested several possible improvements to the chosen haptic hardware actuator\nand software kit, including the introduction of more diverse actuators (e.g., those that can pro-\nduce pressure, temperature, or texture sensations), enhanced software usability with pre-built\n(affective) haptic example patterns, and easier accessible wireless powering options for actua-\ntors to facilitate on-body prototyping without cumbersome wires. The following list contains\nthe details:\n• More Diverse Materials: Some participants suggested that the toolkit could be enhanced\nby including a wider variety of hardware actuators and materials, allowing for more di-\nverse haptic experiences. This would enable designers to experiment with different types\nof feedback and explore a broader range of emotional responses. Practical enhancements\nsuch as providing extension cords and magnets could improve the usability of the toolkit.\nAP1 suggested,\n”Include more actuators for better creativity, include extension cords[...]Maybe\nsome magnets to attach the actuators more easily.’\nThese additions would facilitate easier placement of actuators on different body parts and\nsupport more complex prototyping scenarios.\n• Enhanced Feedback Mechanisms: Participants expressed a desire for more structured\nfeedback mechanisms within the toolkit, such as predefined feedback loops or prompts\nthat could guide them through the iterative design process more usefully.\n• Wireless Options: Several participants mentioned that wireless actuators would have\nmade the prototyping process more seamless, allowing for greater flexibility in testing\nand iterating on designs.\n• Streamline Workshop Structure: Although the workshop was received as helpful in\nteaching the concept of affective haptic design, participants had problems with the com-\npletion of the number of activities within the scheduled workshop timeframe. This made\nthe workshop feel rushed in some parts and should be considered for future conductions\nor applications of certain methodologies of this proposed theoretical toolkit.\n4.7.3\nUnexpected Challenges and Benefits\nParticipants faced a number of technical challenges throughout the prototyping sessions. Sev-\neral participants encountered issues with the DevKit’s Bluetooth connectivity disabling the ac-\ntuators, which led to interruptions in their design process. CP1 and BP1 both mentioned that\nconnectivity problems disrupted the flow of their iterative prototyping. Additionally, BP2 re-\nmarked on the limitations imposed by the narrow variety of actuators available, explaining that\nit restricted their ability to experiment with more complex emotional patterns. These technical"}
{"doc_id": "Vincent_Master_Thesis0225.pdf", "page": 125, "text": "4\nRESULTS\n112\ndifficulties highlight the need for more robust hardware and troubleshooting documentation to\nensure smoother workflows in future iterations of the workshop.\nUnexpectedly, participants also gained valuable emotional insights through the embodied metaphor\nelicitation and body mapping exercises. AP1 expressed that these activities helped them become\n”more aware of bodily sensations”\ntied to emotions, while BP1 noted that the exercises allowed them to\n”translate these sensations into physical prototypes”\nin a more useful, educative manner. However, the process was not without its challenges. CP2,\nfor instance, struggled to apply abstract metaphors like ”comfort” to specific affective haptic\nfeedback. This participant feedback underscores the importance of providing additional guid-\nance and expanding the diversity of hardware (i.e., actuators, easier wireless setup) to better\nsupport the undisrupted design process and therefore the translation of complex emotional con-\ncepts into affective haptic feedback designs.\nParticipants provided detailed feedback on various elements of the workshop. The introduction\nto the Emotion Typology and the circumplex model was widely appreciated, particularly for\ntheir utility in helping participants categorize and articulate complex emotions. BP1 and CP2\nboth mentioned that these models provided a useful structure for thinking about emotion in\nmore concrete terms, especially when trying to translate abstract feelings into haptic feedback\ndesigns.\nHowever, the embodied metaphor elicitation and body mapping activities, while well-received,\nrevealed several challenges. CP1 expressed that while the body maps helped conceptualize the\nconnection between emotion and the body, translating those concepts into haptic feedback was\n’not always intuitive.’ This sentiment was echoed by BP2, who struggled to apply abstract\nmetaphors, such as ’comfort,’ to specific haptic designs. The difficulty in bridging the concep-\ntual understanding of emotions and the practical application of haptics underscores a critical\nlimitation of the workshop: while the exercises successfully facilitated emotional introspection,\nthe toolkit lacked the necessary diversity in actuators and design options to fully realize these\nideas in practice.\nDuring the prototyping sessions, the technical challenges that emerged also impacted partici-\npants’ creative processes. The limited variety of actuators constrained some participants’ ability\nto explore more diverse emotional representations through haptics. BP2 explicitly mentioned\nthat the narrow range of actuators ’limited the ability to experiment with more complex emo-\ntional patterns.’ Additionally, CP1 and BP1 both faced connectivity issues, which further hin-\ndered their ability to iterate on their designs smoothly.

As demonstrated in the workshop feedback, participants, such as CP1, described\nhow the tactile sensation of a plush toy evoked feelings of gratitude and nostalgia. This feedback\nreinforces how specific textures or patterns can anchor emotions within tangible interactions,\nhighlighting the potential of haptic design to deepen emotional engagement through personal-\nized tactile feedback.\nThe Hapticlabs DevKit, while lowering technical barriers, presented challenges that impacted\nthe design process. Participants faced issues such as limited actuator types and connectivity\nproblems. CP1 expressed frustration:\n“Hardware challenges: Bluetooth connection was very bad and hindered the pro-\ncess, wire connection didn’t work, and we had some issues with the interactions\nwith the program as well.”\nSimilarly, BP2 noted,\n“Only having two actuators was difficult because they unfolded their impact only\nlocally.”\nThese technical limitations suggest that the toolkit requires more diverse actuator options and\nmore reliable technical infrastructure to ensure smoother workflows and greater creative flexi-\nbility. An image of the Hapticlabs DevKit used is provided in Figure 4.\n4.7.4\nSuggestions for Improvement\nParticipants also offered constructive feedback for improving the workshop and toolkit. Com-\nmon suggestions included the introduction of more diverse actuators, improved software usabil-\nity, and wireless options for actuators. BP2 remarked:\n”Material that spreads a sensation over the skin! Or a sequence of actuators... The\nsmall local impact is not versatile enough.”\nAP1 suggested allowing for more creative freedom in the workshop, particularly in the explo-\nration of emotions:\n”Maybe in the future it makes sense to let people describe their own words, feelings,\nand not try to limit those to emotions... so that the exploration part is there.”\nParticipants emphasized the importance of wearability in haptic prototyping.\nBP1 recom-\nmended,\n”The toolkit could be more focused on wearables as well; it’s lacking that aspect\nnow—either wireless or easier to attach on the body.”\nThis suggests that making the actuators more wearable could enhance the iteration speed of\nExperience Prototyping and the realism of the prototypes."}

However, challenges\nsuch as technical limitations and the subjective nature of emotions highlight areas for improve-\nment in making the toolkit more versatile and user-friendly for novice designers.\n5\nDiscussion\nThis section interprets the key findings from our study, connecting them to the research ques-\ntions outlined in Section 3.2, the theoretical frameworks discussed in the Introduction and Re-\nlated Work (Section 1 and Section 2), and the broader goals of the study. Through an exam-\nination of direct citations from participants and relevant literature, this section discusses the\nusefulness of the proposed methodological toolkit in assisting novice interaction designers in\nthe creation of emotionally affective haptic feedback prototyping.

These resources are available on the TU Delft website, including detailed\ndescriptions and relatable scenarios for each emotion, which were particularly beneficial for\nnon-native English speakers in phase 3.2.4 of the workshop, especially for expanding their\nemotional vocabulary. Participant BP2 found the Emotion Typology helpful in articulating\nemotions, stating:\n”What I really liked was that you in the beginning brought in the scope of, for me,\nemotions and how these are called or how they feel because when I look at my\nobject that I brought today, it would be hard to come up with the description that I\ncame up with without looking at the emotions that you presented us today.”\nThis indicates that the provided emotional frameworks assisted participants in expressing their\nfeelings more precisely and aligns with the use of Russell’s (1980) Circumplex Model of Affect\nand the refinement proposal by Posner et al. (2005), which provides a structured approach to\norganize, understand, and reduce the complexity of emotions into valence and arousal dimen-\nsions [43, 45]. Ju et al. (2005) proved the utility of such models in Affective Computing and\ndesign [28].\nAP2 expressed that the Emotion Typology helped expand their emotional vocabulary, stating:\n”It actually did open my mind what’s possible in terms of vibration patterns and\nstyles, and how to convey emotions with them. I thought vibration is very one-\ndimensional, present or not. But there is a lot of variation possible, which was new\nto me.”\nHowever, some participants felt constrained by the predefined emotional categories. AP1 sug-\ngested allowing for more personal and nuanced expressions of emotions:\n”I think it also makes sense to not limit a person into the exploration journey... It\ndoesn’t have to be an emotion. It can be just a feeling... something that I can’t\ntranslate to an emotion, but I mean, I can if I’m forced to, but I would choose\ndifferent words for it.”\nThis highlights the limitations of relying solely on predefined emotion typologies and suggests\nthat future iterations of the toolkit should allow for more flexibility in how emotions are ex-\npressed and explored. This is consistent with Eid and Al Osman(2016) emphasis on the impor-\ntance of personal and contextual factors in affective design [18] and the principles of emotional\ndesign proposed by Norman(2004) [40].\nAs mentioned, the Emotions Typology was particularly beneficial for non-native English speak-\ners. AP2 remarked:\n”I also thought the basis of the emotions was very nice because I also hadn’t had\nsome of these words or emotions that clear.”"}
{"doc_id": "Vincent_Master_Thesis0225.pdf", "page": 129, "text": "5\nDISCUSSION\n116\nThis underscores the importance of accessible language and resources in supporting emotional\narticulation, which is essential in the initial stages of affective haptic design.\nHowever, despite the success in emotional articulation, some participants expressed that the\nEmotion Typology and Circumplex Model of Affect might have constrained the emotional\nscope explored. The personal objects participants brought to the workshop were mostly as-\nsociated with positive emotions, limiting the exploration of a more diverse emotional spectrum\nor even leaving the terminology ”emotion” and including a broader definition of sensations\nand feelings as possible affect states to design for. This suggests that future iterations of the\nworkshop should consider introducing additional emotional dimensions, including negative or\nambivalent emotions, to ensure a more comprehensive exploration of affective design possibili-\nties. However, these research efforts must be ethically considerate and well-structured to ensure\nthe participant’s safety and emotional well-being.\n5.2\nEmbodied Metaphors and Body Maps: Enhancing Emotional Trans-\nlation and Communication\nThe integration of embodied metaphors and body maps was instrumental in helping participants\ntranslate and communicate abstract emotional concepts into tangible haptic designs, addressing\nRQ1: ”How do embodied metaphors in combination with body maps impact the design and\ncommunication process of affective haptic feedback for novice designers?” from Section 1.4.\n5.2.1\nEmbodied Metaphors\nThe use of embodied metaphors was instrumental in helping participants shape abstract emo-\ntional concepts into tangible haptic designs. Bakker et al. (2012) highlighted the effectiveness\nof embodied metaphors in interaction design, arguing that they facilitate a deeper connection\nbetween the user’s physical experiences and the design outcome [5].\nParticipants used embodied metaphors to conceptualize haptic patterns. This was successfully\napplied in the case of BP1, who used the metaphor of a basketball dribble to evoke feelings of\nnostalgic calmness in their haptic design for BP2. By anchoring emotions in physical sensations\nand spatial representations, participants were able to create more meaningful haptic feedback\ndesigns. This methodology facilitated a deeper emotional connection to the designs, fostering\nmore meaningful and individualized user-centered single-modal haptic interaction making us-\nage of the emotional memory of the user aligning with the principles of emotional design by\nNorman (2004) [40] mentioned in Section 2.\nThe participants’ feedback illustrates that a useful basis for communication was fostered, even\nthough it was still challenging to express subjective emotional experiences to one another,\nwhich group B adapted to by extending the tandem on-body prototyping with the term ”body-\nstorming”.\nBP1 contributed the following to the group discussion:"}
{"doc_id": "Vincent_Master_Thesis0225.pdf", "page": 130, "text": "5\nDISCUSSION\n117\n”So he [BP2] had an object as a small basketball and then when he shared his\nstory with me about how he used to go to playing with his dad, etc. I understood\nwhat kind of emotion he connected with the object and maybe without the object I\nwouldn’t have been able to understand that good.”\nThis feedback contributes towards the clarification of RQ1 and RQ2 in Section 1.4 and demon-\nstrates how embodied metaphors serve as a bridge between the emotional significance of an\nobject and the haptic patterns designed to evoke similar feelings and how they can be integrated\ninto haptic design processes. By anchoring the design in a familiar physical action or sensation,\nBP1 could create a more meaningful and resonant haptic experience for BP2.\nBP2 further remarked,\n”And then when I was designing, I tried to recreate a dribble of a basketball and\nthat’s maybe not necessarily the feeling that he had or the exhaustion he felt or the\nplayfulness during the match but that was what could I correlate with haptics. And\nin order to find that connection, the pattern, I think this metaphor was really useful\nfor me to go through there and see that. And maybe I couldn’t have been able to do\nor find this easily if we hadn’t the metaphor or the story behind.”\nThis puts the object in a real-life setting, supporting the user empathizing process for user-\ncentered design and therefore supporting the theory of the Experience Prototyping approach\n[11].\nCP1 explained how the physical attributes of their object inspired their haptic design:\n”I mainly used the part of ’physical characteristics.’ I found the size and texture of my object\nvery inspiring... We translated the different textures into different haptic patterns.”\nHowever, some participants found it challenging to translate complex or abstract metaphors into\nhaptic feedback.\nAP2 observed:\n”I feel like this method can work well if you have a metaphor that can be translated\neasily into haptics, but... The more complex the initial embodied metaphor, the\nharder it is to translate.”\nThis suggests that while the methodology is effective for straightforward emotions, additional\nstrategies may be needed to address more abstract or nuanced emotional states.\nAP1 mentioned the desire for more creative freedom beyond straightforward translations:\n”It helped identifying certain qualities or emotions I can focus on when designing haptics, but I\nalso don’t find it very interesting translating it this straightforwardly. I want to be more creative,\nand body maps are better for that.”\nThis suggests that while embodied metaphors are valuable, they may require careful selection\nand simplification to be effectively integrated into haptic designs, particularly for novice inter-\naction designers."}
{"doc_id": "Vincent_Master_Thesis0225.pdf", "page": 131, "text": "5\nDISCUSSION\n118\n5.2.2\nBody Maps\nBody maps contributed to the emotional translation process by helping participants identify\nwhere emotions are felt in the body and consider appropriate actuator placement. Nummen-\nmaa et al. (2014) explored body maps of emotions, showing how certain emotional states\n(e.g. Anger, Fear, Disgust, Happiness, Sadness, Neutral, Anxiety, Love, Depression, Contempt,\nPride, Shame, Envy) have overlapping commonality in their physical experience in the body, re-\ninforcing the important concept of norming considerate spatial placement of actuators to foster\nthe research of recreational affective haptic feedback principles. Cochrane et al. (2022) further\nemphasized the importance of body mapping in understanding and documenting the somatic\naspects of emotional experiences in design [15].\nAP1 shared:\n”I agree with the whole method of body maps helping to understand the emotion\nand where I feel it, and you can just become more aware of your own body.”\nThis self-awareness is crucial in affective design, as it allows designers to create more personal-\nized and impactful haptic feedback. The activity encouraged participants to consider the phys-\niological aspects of emotional experiences, such as the heightened sensitivity of certain body\nparts like the face, hands, and feet. This further emphasizes the role of embodied cognition\n(Hollan et al., 2000) [25] - emphasising the significance of bodily experiences and sensorimo-\ntor interactions in shaping cognitive processes - in the field of affective design, where the body\nbecomes both a site of emotional experience and a design canvas constantly affecting each other.\nHowever, challenges arose when attempting to stimulate certain body parts with haptic feed-\nback. AP1 further explained:\n”When it comes to translating now this body map to the haptic design, I think it’s\nsometimes not really straightforward... Because it’s one thing to have this feeling\ncoming from the inside... and then it’s another thing to provoke it with the external\nstimulator.”\nCP1 noted a disconnect between initial mapping and later stages:\n”We focused a lot on creating a certain sensation with the vibration motors and then didn’t think\nall that much about where this sensation would work best because prototyping was easiest on\nthe hands and we didn’t really adapt it after—maybe because of lack of time.” This highlights\nthe importance of allocating sufficient time for exploration and iteration in the design process.\nFuture workshops should consider extending the duration or streamlining activities to allow\nparticipants to experiment with different actuator placements and refine their designs based on\nthe insights gained from body mapping.\nParticipants reported discomfort when actuators were placed on sensitive areas like the chest or\nstomach, highlighting the need for careful consideration of actuator placement and the type of\nhaptic stimuli used. This matches with Tsetserukou et al.’s (2009) findings on the importance\nof user comfort and the emotional appropriateness of stimuli in Affective Haptics [55]."}
{"doc_id": "Vincent_Master_Thesis0225.pdf", "page": 132, "text": "5\nDISCUSSION\n119\n5.2.3\nComplementary Use of Embodied Metaphors and Body Maps\nWhile embodied metaphors provided a valuable method for translating abstract emotions into\nhaptic designs, the integration of body maps further enriched this process by helping design-\ners consider the physical manifestation of emotions in the body. This complementary use of\nmethodologies offered a multi-dimensional approach to affective haptic design, enhancing the\ndepth and relevance of the prototypes developed. While both tools were valuable individually,\ntheir combined use presented some challenges. BP2 mentioned:\n”In the second step... the body maps were just, for me, documentation... We didn’t\nuse it for that type [on-body prototyping feedback] of communication.”\nThis indicates that participants may have struggled to integrate the insights from embodied\nmetaphors and body maps seamlessly into their prototyping design process but they provided\na valuable foundation for the preparation process. Future workshops could provide more guid-\nance on how to effectively combine these methodologies before the prototyping process or en-\nhance the usefulness of emotional translation and communication within (tandem) design teams\nduring the on-body prototyping processes.\nCP2 also emphasized the value of the methodology templates offered and the workshop workspace\nsetup in the room (see Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure B) and on Miro (see Appendix B in the design\nprocess:\n”They were great! Much needed to have a detailed overview of the design process.\nAs you need to zoom in and out multiple times on the emotions, body parts, feel-\nings, haptics, etc. This setup provided an opportunity to do so and freedom to do it\nthe way you wish as a designer.”\nOverall the use of embodied metaphors and body maps in the workshop helped participants\narticulate their emotions more effectively. Turmo Vidal et al. (2023) have shown how body\nmaps serve as an insightful tool for understanding and documenting where emotions manifest\nphysically [56], which aligns well with the proposed approach in the workshop. Additionally,\nNardon and Hari (2021) emphasize the role of metaphors in bridging the gap between abstract\nemotional concepts and physical sensations, enhancing user engagement and emotional com-\nmunication [39].\n5.3\nTechnical and Conceptual Challenges in Affective Haptic Design\nIn response to RQ3: ”What challenges do novice designers face when designing affective haptic\nfeedback, and how can these challenges be overcome?”, the study identified several obstacles\nthat novice designers encountered, primarily related to technical complexity and the subjective\nnature of emotional interpretation. The varying levels of familiarity with haptic prototyping\nand coding skills among participants necessitated a workshop structure that could accommo-\ndate both relatively experienced individuals and complete novices. While the Haptic Labs"}

Furthermore, the subjective interpretation of emotions presented a chal-\nlenge in designing universally resonant haptic feedback, as personal experiences and emotional\nresponses varied widely among participants.\nAP2’s observation that\n”applying the haptics to the body feels like you always come back to the same\nthing... I find it hard to see a completely different application”\nunderscores the constraints posed by limited actuator types and placement options. This sug-\ngests that expanding the variety of actuators and exploring alternative body areas could facilitate\nmore diverse and innovative haptic designs, allowing designers to move beyond standard appli-\ncations and explore new possibilities in affective haptic feedback.\nParticipant BP2 suggested that incorporating predefined haptic patterns and intensity settings\ninto the software could enhance the usability and usefulness of the Hapticlabs Studio in the\ncontext of this affective haptic workshop toolkit.\n”The software wasn’t very intuitive. If you work with the body, you can already\nprovide patterns and intensities reflecting on the type of feedback you want to get.”\nThis feature could help novice designers more quickly create and test haptic feedback aligned\nwith specific emotional states.\n5.3.1\nTechnical Complexity and Toolkit Limitations\nParticipants faced several technical challenges with the Hapticlabs DevKit and Hapticlabs Stu-\ndio Software, including connectivity issues and a restriction of their design exploration through\nthe limited amount of actuators - one of each kind, and two connectable at the same time to the\nhardware satellite - contained within the Hapticlabs DevKit. CP1 experienced hardware issues\nthat hindered the design process and noted following feedback down in their concluding survey:\n”Hardware challenges: Bluetooth connection was very bad and hindered the pro-\ncess, wire connection didn’t work, and we had some issues with the interactions\nwith the program as well (dragging, resizing, copying, selecting, going back).”\nSimilarly, BP2 highlighted the limitations of the Hapticlabs DevKit satellite that allowed the\nusage of two actuators at the same time:\n”Only having two actuators was difficult because they unfolded their impact only\nlocally.”"}

Participants like CP1 experienced connectivity\nproblems and software glitches, which impeded the seamless execution of their design pro-\ncesses. Additionally, the limited number of actuators constrained the complexity and spatial\ndistribution of haptic feedback patterns, potentially limiting the emotional expressiveness of\nthe designs. These technical barriers suggest a need for more versatile and beginner-friendly\nprototyping tools to fully realize the potential of low-fidelity haptic prototyping in affective\ndesign.\nThese technical issues hindered participants’ ability to fully explore and prototype their LoFi\ndesigns, suggesting the need for more robust and versatile non-coding hardware toolkits. This\naligns with Seifi et al.’s (2019) emphasis on the importance of accessible, versatile, and user-\nfriendly haptic design tools in their Haptipedia project [47].\nAP1 also mentioned the constraints imposed by the hardware of the Hapticlabs Devkit:\n”It’s hard to design something when you only have one instance of a type of actua-\ntor... the kit didn’t limit us in terms of ideation but implementation.”\nBP2 suggested expanding the types of sensations available:\n”Material that spreads a sensation over the skin!

Ju et al. (2021)\nemphasized that empathy plays a crucial role in effective emotional design, highlighting that\nhaptic interfaces need to convey nuanced emotional meanings to match user expectations ac-\ncurately. Similarly, Vyas et al. (2023) identified individual emotional differences as a central\nchallenge for designers of affective systems, suggesting the need for iterative prototyping and\nreal-time feedback mechanisms. Eid and Al Osman (2016) further discussed the complexities of\nAffective Computing, noting that individual variability in emotional response requires systems\nthat are adaptive and capable of multimodal interaction to ensure a meaningful user experience.\nThese works illustrate that aligning technological intent with user experience in affective design\ndemands a comprehensive, iterative, and user-centered approach [18, 28, 57] and suggest that\ndesigning affective haptic feedback requires a nuanced understanding of both the emotional and\nphysiological aspects of the haptic UX.\nBP2’s observation,\n”It was his really subjective feeling that I tried to resemble and implement... we had\nto give feedback to each other and communicate really well what we were trying to\ndo,”\nhighlights the challenge of interpreting and translating another person’s subjective emotional\nexperience into a haptic design. This underscores the importance of effective communication\nand empathy in collaborative design processes, as well as the need for methods that can help\nbridge the gap between individual emotional perceptions.\nSimilarly, AP1’s reflection,\n”It’s one thing to have this feeling coming from the inside... and then it’s another\nthing to provoke it with the external stimulator,”\nemphasizes the complexity of eliciting internal emotional states through external stimuli. This\npoints to the viability of incorporating both cognitive and somatic approaches in affective haptic\ndesign to create more authentic and tailored affective user experiences.\n5.4\nTandem Design Approach: Enhancing Collaboration and Iterative\nLearning\nOne of the most significant contributions of the thesis and the workshop was the introduction of\nthe Tandem Design approach, where participants alternated between the roles of designer and\nuser. This collaborative methodology facilitated peer learning and fostered empathy between\nparticipants as they worked together to translate emotions into haptic feedback."}

{"doc_id": "Vincent_Master_Thesis0225.pdf", "page": 137, "text": "5\nDISCUSSION\n124\n5.4.2\nImpact of the Tandem Design Approach versus single-designer Setting\nThe Tandem Design approach employed in our study significantly enhanced the affective haptic\ndesign process by embodying principles of Experience Prototyping as described by Buchenau\nand Suri (2000) [11]. This approach aligns with their assertion that ”Experience Prototyping\nsimulates important aspects of the whole or parts of the relationships between people, places,\nand objects as they unfold over time” (p. 431), contributing to design in three key ways: under-\nstanding existing user experiences, exploring and evaluating design ideas, and communicating\nideas to an audience.\nBy alternating roles between designer and user, participants engaged in a form of experiential\nlearning that allowed them to gain firsthand appreciation of each other’s emotional and somatic\nexperiences. This facilitated a deeper understanding of the essence of the emotional states they\naimed to evoke through haptic feedback. BP2 reflected on this process:\n”Through communication, I felt like it was way better that we expressed the first-\nperson felt experience... we had to give feedback to each other and communicate\nreally well what we were trying to do.”\nThis collaborative dynamic mirrors Buchenau and Suri’s (2000) emphasis on the importance of\nshared experiences in developing a common vision within a multidisciplinary team:\n”To work effectively as a design team it is important to develop a common vision of\nwhat the team is trying to bring into being. Therefore, it is a powerful asset to have\ntools and techniques, which create a shared experience, providing a foundation for\na common point of view” [11]\nIn the context of our study, the Tandem Design approach enabled participants to explore and\nevaluate design ideas more effectively. By experiencing the haptic feedback designed by their\npartners, participants could provide immediate, subjective feedback, facilitating iterative refine-\nment. BP1 noted:\n”By hearing [BP2]’s story, I was able to do the design way easier.”\nThis experiential engagement resonates with the idea that\n”Information becomes more vivid and engaging when it resonates with personal\nexperience” [11]\n, leading to designs that are more attuned to users’ emotional needs.\nConversely, a single-designer setting, where individuals design haptic feedback for themselves,\nlacks this level of collaborative insight. While designing for oneself allows for an intimate\nunderstanding of personal emotions, it may also introduce limitations related to personal biases\nand a narrower perspective. AP1 expressed challenges in articulating personal feelings:"}
{"doc_id": "Vincent_Master_Thesis0225.pdf", "page": 138, "text": "5\nDISCUSSION\n125\n”It’s one thing to have this feeling coming from the inside... and then it’s another\nthing to provoke it with the external stimulator.”\nThis introspective approach might limit the exploration of diverse emotional expressions and re-\nduce opportunities for validation through external feedback. Buchenau and Suri (2000) caution\nthat\n”The tools we use to design, such as prototypes, influence the way we think. Solu-\ntions, and probably even imagination, are inspired and limited by the prototyping\ntools we have at our disposal” [11]\n. In a single-designer setting, the lack of collaborative tools like the Tandem Design approach\nmay constrain the designer’s ability to think beyond their own experiences.\nMoreover, the Tandem Design approach helps designers\n”[..] get away from technological limitations [and] focus on exploring the human\nperspective, somatic experience.” [11]\nParticipants in our study emphasized the value of focusing on the user’s bodily experiences\nrather than being constrained by technical aspects. BP2 stated:\n”We were kind of narrowing ourselves a bit because we were having this kind\nof metaphor in our head and trying to re-enact it through the vibration... But for\nthe first part, I would definitely say that it was nice to think about where emotion\nhappens and how that could be.”\nThis reflects the importance of prioritizing the human experience in design, a core tenet of\nExperience Prototyping.\nHowever, the Tandem Design approach also presented challenges. Participants had to navigate\nsubjective interpretations of emotions and ensure clear communication to align their design\nintentions. BP2 observed:\n”It was his really subjective feeling that I tried to resemble and implement... and\nthat also connects to the emotionality of the process.”\nThis highlights a potential limitation, as effective Experience Prototyping requires careful con-\nsideration of\n”[..]setting the stage[..]”\nand being explicit about context, as Buchenau and Suri (2000) suggest:"}
{"doc_id": "Vincent_Master_Thesis0225.pdf", "page": 139, "text": "5\nDISCUSSION\n126\n”To create an appropriate prototype we need to determine [..] what context sur-\nrounds the user experience.”[11]\nIn comparing the two approaches, it becomes evident that the Tandem Design method enhances\nthe design process by fostering empathy, collaborative exploration, and richer communication of\nideas. It supports the three key contributions of Experience Prototyping identified by Buchenau\nand Suri (2000):\n1. Understanding existing user experiences and context: By engaging with a partner’s\nemotional experiences, designers gain insights that might be inaccessible in a single-\ndesigner setting.\n2. Exploring and evaluating design ideas: Collaborative prototyping allows for immediate\nfeedback and iterative refinement, aligning with the notion that:\n”Experience Prototyping can provide inspiration, confirmation or rejection of\nideas based upon the quality of experience they engender.” [11]\n3. Communicating ideas to an audience: Shared experience facilitates a common under-\nstanding, essential for multidisciplinary collaboration.\nIn a single-designer setting, while the designer may have a deep understanding of their own\nemotions, the lack of external input may limit the design’s applicability and resonance with oth-\ners. As AP1 suggested, allowing for personal expression is valuable, but incorporating others’\nperspectives enriches the design process:\n”Maybe in the future it makes sense to let people describe their own words, feelings,\nand then try to limit those. But initially, so that the exploration part is there.”\nIn conclusion, the Tandem Design approach, embodying the principles of Experience Prototyp-\ning, significantly enhances the affective haptic design process by enabling designers to engage\nmore deeply with users’ emotional and somatic experiences. It overcomes some limitations of\ndesigning solely for oneself by fostering empathy, promoting collaborative exploration, and im-\nproving communication of design ideas. This approach aligns with Buchenau and Suri’s (2000)\nemphasis on the value of active engagement and shared experiences in design, ultimately lead-\ning to more meaningful and resonant haptic feedback systems.\n5.5\nMethodological Considerations\nThe study’s methodology provided valuable insights but also presented certain limitations."}

AP1 commented:\n”I thought there were multiple activities throughout the workshop that you kind of\nskipped and moved to the bigger ones... which kind of made me feel confused.”\nAP2 echoed:\n”There was a part where we kind of did some small things very quickly and then\nmoved on right away to the next thing. But it felt like just a little bit quick or\nsomething.”\nThese remarks indicate a necessity for more explicit instructions, improved pacing, and more\nseamless transitions between activities in forthcoming workshops.\nBP1 appreciated the interactive nature of the workshop:\n”I love that you made it more interactive... Having like your part of like how I did\nit then was easier for me to understand the whole situation and I went onwards.”\nCP2 described the initial challenge and eventual benefit of the workshop:\n”It was new to me which made it challenging at first. However, the structured and\norganized approach used during the workshop made it a guided process.”\nThe suggestion by CP1 to include a physical prototyping phase—\n”brainstorm on metaphors and where you could possibly put the device... and\nmaybe also prototype with fabrics or other things before using the software”\n— indicates a need for more tactile exploration in the design process. Incorporating this step\ncould help designers better visualize and test how the haptic feedback device integrates with the\nbody, potentially leading to more innovative and user-friendly designs.\nParticipants expressed a desire for more exploratory and creative processes within the workshop.\nBP2 mentioned, ’\n”I would love to keep an explorative and creative process, something like body-\nstorming.”\nIncorporating such methodologies could foster innovation and allow designers to experiment\nmore freely with haptic feedback concepts.\nAfter considering how the body map and embodied metaphor elicitation sheet templates were\nused during the prototyping process, they were useful in establishing a baseline using the mate-\nrials provided for collaborative prototyping. However, during the prototyping phase, the work-\nshop structure should encourage unrestricted exploration, regardless of whether it incorporates\npreviously introduced methodologies from the tandem on-body prototyping."}

CP1 mentioned:\n”Having the comfort objects here for inspiration was very helpful, though I do think\nthey guided our design very strongly, maybe a bit too strongly.”\nThis indicates that while personal objects provide a relatable starting point, they may constrain\ncreative exploration if relied upon the contained emotion or interaction with it exclusively. Fu-\nture workshops could encourage participants to explore a wider range of emotions beyond those\nassociated with their personal objects and just use them for the introduction of metaphorical\nthinking.\nWhile personal objects helped ground the emotional exploration, participants like CP1 felt that\nthey might have guided the design too strongly, potentially limiting creativity:\n”I do think they guided our design very strongly, maybe a bit too strongly.”\nThis suggests that while personal objects provide a relatable starting point, they may constrain\ndesigners to specific emotions associated with those objects. Future workshops could encour-\nage participants to explore a wider range of emotions beyond those directly associated with\ntheir personal items, promoting a more comprehensive understanding of affective haptic design\nprinciples.\nAP1 advocated for allowing participants to define their own emotional terms:\n”Maybe in the future it makes sense to let people describe their own words, feelings,\nand not try to limit those to emotions... So that the exploration part is there.”\nAlthough using personal objects helped ground the emotional exploration by providing tangi-\nble references, this approach may have inadvertently limited the scope of emotions considered.\nParticipants primarily associated their objects with positive emotions, which constrained the\nexploration to a narrower emotional spectrum. To encourage a wider range of emotional explo-\nration, future workshops could introduce neutral or unfamiliar objects or encourage participants\nto consider emotions beyond those directly associated with their personal items.

The findings from this study address the initial research questions (see in Section\n1.4) and contribute valuable insights into the fields of Affective Haptics and HCI.\n6.1\nSummary of Key Contributions\nThe most significant contribution of this research is the demonstration of how a structured\nmethodological toolkit can aid novice interaction designers in the complex task of creating\naffective haptic feedback. The integration of theoretical frameworks and practical methodolo-\ngies provided participants with tools to articulate emotions, translate them into haptic designs,\nand iteratively refine their prototypes based on user feedback.\n6.1.1\nEmotion Articulation and Translation\nThe use of the Emotion Typology and the Circumplex Model of Affect significantly enhanced\nparticipants’ ability to articulate and categorize emotions. As BP2 noted:\n”What I really liked was that you in the beginning brought in the scope of, for me,\nemotions and how these are called or how they feel because... it would be hard to\ncome up with the description that I came up with without looking at the emotions\nthat you presented us today.”\nThis structured approach enabled participants, including non-native English speakers like AP2,\nto expand their emotional vocabulary and provided a foundation for designing haptic feedback\nthat aligns with specific emotional states. This aligns with Russell’s (1980) and Posner et al.’s\n(2005) emphasis on the utility of such models in organizing emotional experiences [43, 45].\n6.1.2\nEmbodied Metaphors and Body Maps\nThe methodologies of embodied metaphors and body maps proved instrumental in bridging\nthe gap between abstract emotions and tangible haptic designs. Participants like BP1 and BP2\nsuccessfully used embodied metaphors to inform their designs. Participant BP1 explained:\n”When I was designing, I tried to recreate a dribble of a basketball... And maybe I\nwouldn’t have been able to... find this easily if we hadn’t the metaphor or the story\nbehind.”\nThis approach resonates with Bakker et al.’s (2012) findings on the effectiveness of embodied\nmetaphors in interaction design [5]. Body maps further aided in visualizing where emotions are\nfelt in the body, assisting in actuator placement decisions. AP1 highlighted:"}

This participatory methodology allowed for real-time feedback and refinement, es-\nsential in affective haptic design where emotional nuances are critical. BP2 reflected:\n”Through communication, I felt like it was way better that we expressed the first-\nperson felt experience.”\nThis approach aligns with Buchenau and Suri’s (2000) concept of Experience Prototyping, em-\nphasizing the importance of designers immersing themselves in the user’s experience to create\nmore effective designs [11].\n6.1.4\nToolkit Usefulness and Limitations\nThe use of the Hapticlabs DevKit lowered some technical barriers by eliminating the need for\ncoding, allowing participants to focus more on the creative aspects of haptic design. However,\nlimitations in hardware diversity and software usability constrained participants’ ability to fully\nexplore and prototype their designs. CP1 mentioned:\n”Hardware challenges: Bluetooth connection was very bad and hindered the pro-\ncess... we had some issues with the interactions with the program as well.”\nThese limitations highlight the need for more versatile and user-friendly tools to support novice\ninteraction designers, as emphasized by Seifi et al. (2019) in their Haptipedia project [47].\n6.2\nAddressing the Research Questions\nThe following section will address the research questions of this thesis one by one, which were\nproposed in section 1.4."}
{"doc_id": "Vincent_Master_Thesis0225.pdf", "page": 144, "text": "6\nCONCLUSION\n131\n6.2.1\nRQ1: Impact of Embodied Metaphors in Combination with Body Maps\nEmbodied metaphors and body maps improved the design and communication process for\nnovice interaction designers by providing concrete tools to articulate and translate experien-\ntial emotions into haptic designs. Participants reported that these tools helped them map emo-\ntional experiences to physical sensations, leading to more meaningful and personalized haptic\nfeedback.\nFor instance, participant BP1 used the metaphor of a basketball dribble to create haptic patterns\nthat resonated with their partner’s emotional narrative, enhancing empathy and user-centered\ndesign. BP1 noted:\n”By hearing [BP2]’s story, I was able to do the design way easier.”\nAdditionally, body maps enabled designers to identify where emotions are physically felt, in-\nforming actuator placement and haptic intensity. Participant AP1 expressed:\n”I agree with the whole method of body maps helping to understand the emotion\nand where I feel it, and you can just become more aware of your own body.”\nThese tools also enhanced communication among designers and between designers and users.\nBy using shared metaphors and visual representations of emotional experiences, participants\nfound it easier to convey abstract feelings and collaborate effectively.\nHowever, challenges were encountered when dealing with complex or abstract metaphors that\nwere difficult to translate into haptic feedback. Participant AP2 observed:\n”I feel like this method can work well if you have a metaphor that can be translated\neasily into haptics, but... the more complex the initial embodied metaphor, the\nharder it is to translate.”\nFurthermore, certain body areas were sensitive or uncomfortable for actuator placement, limit-\ning the use of body maps in some cases. Participants reported discomfort when actuators were\nplaced on areas like the chest or stomach.\nTo mitigate these challenges, future applications should provide additional guidance on select-\ning and simplifying metaphors, perhaps incorporating workshops on metaphor creation and\ntranslation. Alternative strategies, such as offering a library of sample metaphors or encour-\naging iterative testing with user feedback, can aid in translating complex emotions. Designers\nshould also consider user comfort and preferences when determining actuator placement, pos-\nsibly by allowing users to select preferred stimulation areas.\nOverall, embodied metaphors and body maps proved to be valuable tools that, when carefully\nadapted, can greatly enhance the affective haptic design process for novice designers by foster-\ning empathy, improving communication, and grounding abstract emotions in tangible designs."}

This hands-on, collaborative process fostered empa-\nthy and a deeper understanding of users’ emotional experiences.\nBy alternating roles between designer and user, participants gained firsthand insights into how\ntheir designs impacted others, leading to more emotionally resonant haptic feedback. Partici-\npant BP2 remarked:\n”Through communication, I felt like it was way better that we expressed the first-\nperson felt experience... we had to give feedback to each other and communicate\nreally well what we were trying to do.”\nThis collaborative environment enriched perspectives and improved communication, enabling\ndesigners to receive immediate feedback and make adjustments accordingly.\nHowever, technical limitations hindered the sessions. Hardware constraints, such as limited\nactuator types and connectivity issues with the Hapticlabs DevKit, restricted the scope of ex-\nploration and sometimes caused frustration. Software usability issues also impeded the smooth\nexecution of prototypes.\nAdditionally, participants identified a need for clearer communication strategies to effectively\nconvey and interpret emotional feedback. The subjective nature of emotions meant that without\neffective dialogue, designers might misinterpret user responses.\nTo improve future prototyping sessions, it is recommended to incorporate more robust and ver-\nsatile hardware, such as devices with a greater variety of actuators and reliable connectivity.\nProviding training on effective communication techniques, including active listening and artic-\nulating emotional experiences, can enhance collaboration. Structured communication exercises\nor guidelines could be integrated into the sessions to support this.\nBy addressing technical limitations and enhancing communication strategies, future low-fidelity\non-body prototyping sessions can further optimize the benefits of the Tandem Design approach,\nleading to more effective and emotionally resonant haptic designs.\n6.2.3\nRQ3: Challenges Faced by Novice Interaction Designers\nNovice interaction designers faced several challenges during the integration of haptic feedback\ninto low-fidelity prototypes. Technical complexities, such as software glitches and limited hard-\nware capabilities, impeded their ability to create diverse and sophisticated haptic designs. For\nexample, participant CP1 experienced hardware issues:\n”Hardware challenges: Bluetooth connection was very bad and hindered the pro-\ncess... we had some issues with the interactions with the program as well.”"}
{"doc_id": "Vincent_Master_Thesis0225.pdf", "page": 146, "text": "6\nCONCLUSION\n133\nThe limited number of actuators and types available restricted creative possibilities, making it\ndifficult to prototype complex haptic patterns or spatially distributed feedback. Participant AP1\nnoted:\n”It’s hard to design something when you only have one instance of a type of actua-\ntor... the kit didn’t limit us in terms of ideation but implementation.”\nThe subjective nature of emotional interpretation added another layer of difficulty. Design-\ners grappled with translating personal emotions into haptic patterns that would be universally\nunderstandable and emotionally impactful. As participant AP1 expressed:\n”It’s one thing to have this feeling coming from the inside... and then it’s another\nthing to provoke it with the external stimulator.”\nIndividual differences in emotional experiences and perceptions made it challenging to create\ndesigns that resonated with others.\nTo overcome these obstacles, several mitigation strategies are suggested:\n• Technical Enhancements: Providing more intuitive and reliable technical tools can re-\nduce technical barriers. This includes hardware with diverse and multiple actuators, sta-\nble connectivity, and beginner-friendly software interfaces with features like predefined\nhaptic patterns.\n• Prior Comprehensive Training: Offering training prior to the main activities that cover\nboth the technical aspects of haptic design and the nuances of emotional translation can\nbetter prepare novice designers and therefore make better use of the limited time for the\nexploratory experience prototyping process. Workshops on haptic technology, emotional\nexpression, and user experience design can enhance the competence and confidence of\nnovice interaction designers.\n• Emphasis on Communication and Empathy: Encouraging open dialogue, active lis-\ntening, and empathy in the design process is crucial. Techniques such as empathic in-\nterviewing and collaborative reflection can help designers understand users’ emotional\nstates more deeply.\n• Mentorship and Support: Providing access to experienced mentors or facilitators can\nguide novice designers through challenges, offering advice and sharing best practices.\nBy implementing these strategies, novice interaction designers can be better equipped to nav-\nigate technical complexities and the subjective nature of emotional interpretation, leading to\nmore effective and innovative haptic designs."}

The workshop outcomes and participants’\nfeedback demonstrate that a carefully designed combination of user-friendly hardware, intu-\nitive software, and supportive methodologies can make on-body affective haptic prototyping\naccessible to novice interaction designers. This integrated approach addresses technical lim-\nitations, supports creative exploration, and substantially fosters the prototyping stage for the\ndevelopment of affective haptic feedback systems.\n6.3\nImplications for Future Research and Practice\nThe findings from this study have several implications for future research and practice in affec-\ntive haptic design and HCI:\n6.3.1\nEnhancing Educational Tools and Resources\nIntegrating structured emotional frameworks and practical methodologies into interaction de-\nsign education can aid novice interaction designers in their affective haptic prototyping pro-\ncesses. As participant AP1 suggested, providing more vague and broader emotional vocabular-\nies can encourage greater creativity and personal expression.\nThe use of the toolkit could enhance the learning process for novice interaction designers by\nproviding structured methods for prototyping, aligning with Spinuzzi’s (2005) principles of\nparticipatory design and Buchenau’s approach of Experience Prototyping [11, 51]. By fur-\nther expanding and incorporating methods like Moussette’s (2012) ”sketching in hardware,” the\ntoolkit could lower learning barriers, making haptic prototyping more accessible and engaging\nfor those without a deep technical [38] or psychology background.\n6.3.2\nImproving Haptic Prototyping Toolkits\nDeveloping more versatile and beginner-friendly haptic prototyping toolkits and frameworks is\nessential. This includes incorporating a wider variety of actuators capable of producing diverse\nsensations (e.g., pressure, temperature, texture), improving software interfaces to be more intu-\nitive and supportive of creative exploration, and offering accessible methodologies to bridge the\npsychological component of emotional design with the technical development of prototypes.\nImproving the control software interfaces of the haptic hardware kits to be more intuitive and\nsupportive of creative exploration is equally important. Simplifying the interaction with soft-\nware and including pre-designed haptic feedback patterns and interactive tutorials could lower\nthe entry barrier for novice interaction designers. This enhancement would allow designers to"}

This approach fosters a deeper understanding of\nusers’ emotional experiences and supports iterative refinement based on real-time feedback,\nfacilitating greater empathy and iterative refinement of designs.\n6.3.4\nExpanding Research Contexts and Participant Diversity\nFuture research should involve a larger and more diverse participant pool to capture a broader\nrange of experiences and perspectives. Involving participants from different cultural back-\ngrounds, age groups, and levels of design experience would enhance the validity and appli-\ncability of the results, ensuring that the toolkit and methodologies are applicable to a broader\naudience.\nTesting the components of the modular toolkit in various application domains, such as mental\nhealth therapy, entertainment technology, and social communication, can provide deeper in-\nsights into its effectiveness, usefulness, and versatility. This broader application could reveal\nunique challenges and opportunities specific to different contexts.\n6.3.5\nConducting Longitudinal Studies\nLongitudinal studies would allow for the assessment of the sustained impact of the individual\ncomponents of the modular toolkit (e.g., hardware, software, methodologies) on participants’\nskills and their ability to engage in affective haptic design over time. This could inform the\ndevelopment of more effective educational programs and resources. By tracking participants’\nprogress over extended periods, researchers can gain insights into how proficiency and confi-\ndence in affective haptic design develop and how sustained use of the toolkit influences design\npractices.\n6.3.6\nImproving Workshop Structure and Communication Strategies\nFeedback indicated that aspects of the workshop structure could be improved to enhance par-\nticipant engagement and learning outcomes. AP1 mentioned feeling confused due to skipped\nactivities and redundant information.\nAddressing these issues by providing clearer instructions, better pacing, and ensuring that all\nactivities are meaningfully integrated could improve the overall effectiveness of the workshop."}

Providing training on effective\ncommunication techniques, including active listening and articulating emotional experiences,\ncan enhance collaboration and reduce misunderstandings.\n6.4\nLimitations of the Study\nSeveral limitations must be acknowledged:\n• Sample Size and Diversity: The small and relatively homogeneous participant sample\nlimits the generalizability of the findings. All participants were advanced students in HCI-\nrelated fields, which may have influenced their engagement with and comprehension of\nthe proposed methodologies and tools used in this workshop.\n• Technical Constraints: Hardware limitations, such as the limited number and type of\nactuators, impacted participants’ ability to fully explore and implement their haptic design\nideas. Software usability issues also hindered the design process for some participants.\n• Workshop Structure: Some participants found parts of the workshop confusing or rushed,\nindicating a need for prior familiarization sessions with the hardware and software used\nin the workshop, considerate time planning for the included activities of the workshop,\nclearer instructions and better pacing during the execution of it.\nThese limitations suggest that the findings may not fully represent the challenges faced by\na broader or more diverse group of novice interaction designers in learning the principles of\naffective haptic feedback design.

Participants engaged with intimate emotional experiences, necessitating careful\nhandling to ensure their well-being. This thesis adhered to ethical guidelines by obtaining in-\nformed consent, ensuring participants were fully aware of the study’s objectives and their right\nto withdraw at any time. During discussions of personal emotions, it was made sure to not over-\nwhelm or force any participant to share and notice attentive to signs of discomfort, and provide\nsupport or time as needed. Additionally, this study avoided eliciting negative emotions that"}

By combining theoretical frameworks with practical methodologies, collaborative\napproaches, and the creation of a workshop structure and methodological templates specified\nfor single-modal affective haptic design with a no-coding haptic hardware toolkit, this thesis\naddresses key challenges in teaching and researching affective haptic prototyping.\nWhile technical limitations and the subjective nature of emotions present ongoing challenges,\nthe positive reception of the toolkit and methodologies indicates a promising direction for future\ndevelopment. As BP1 suitably concluded:\n”Connecting emotions through the objects creates a very important baseline and\nconceptual understanding for the haptic design.”\nThis thesis addresses key challenges in teaching and researching affective haptic prototyping\nby combining theoretical human-centered methodologies and a version of a commercial non-\ncoding haptic prototyping kit. It further emphasizes the importance of emotional resonance and\nhuman-centered design in technological innovation regarding the imitation and utilization of\nhuman touch properties, i.e. vibrotactile haptic feedback, and the impactful reactions that can\nbe triggered within the users of these affective haptic systems. Refining the toolkit and enhanc-\ning educational resources will empower new interaction designers to engage deeply with the\nemotional aspects of haptic human-computer interaction through collaborative, user-centered\npractices.\nThe insights gained from this study provide a foundation for future work aimed at develop-\ning more sophisticated, user-centered, and emotionally personalized affective haptic interaction\nprototypes. By managing the pinpointed challenges and incorporating the suggested workshop\nrefinements, future iterations of the toolkit and workshop structure can further advance the field,\nultimately enhancing the research and prototyping processes of how we interact with technology\non an emotional level and therefore empowering novice interaction designers to create AHFS\nthat genuinely connect with target users on a profound personal emotional level. This ensures\nthat this delicate third-wave HCI topic steers the development and research of Affective Haptics\nin a positive, empowering, and ethically considerate direction.\n10https://www.apa.org/ethics/code"}

This informs the design of affective\nsystems and haptic feedback mechanisms.\nEmbodied Metaphor Elicitation: A design approach that translates abstract emotional con-\ncepts into physical and tangible design elements by using metaphors grounded in bodily\nexperiences.\nExperience Prototyping: A prototyping method focused on evaluating and iterating on user\nexperiences. It emphasizes immersing designers and users in interactive prototypes to\nunderstand experiential aspects.\nLo-Fi Prototyping: The creation of low-fidelity, simplified prototypes that capture basic de-\nsign ideas. Lo-fi prototyping is often used in early design stages for quick iteration and\nfeedback gathering.\nTandem Design: A collaborative design process in which two participants alternate between\nthe roles of designer and user. This iterative approach helps refine the design by continu-\nously incorporating feedback from both perspectives.\nHapticlabs DevKit: A toolkit designed for creating and testing haptic feedback. It includes\nvarious haptic actuators and a user-friendly interface that enables the design of haptic\npatterns without requiring programming skills.\nERM (Eccentric Rotating Mass) Actuators: A type of actuator that produces vibration by\nspinning an unbalanced mass. Common in mobile devices, it is used for basic vibration\nfeedback such as alerts or notifications.\nLRA (Linear Resonant Actuator) Actuators: Actuators that generate vibrations through lin-\near oscillations. These actuators are known for delivering precise and efficient haptic\nfeedback with fast response times and low energy consumption.\nPiezoelectric Actuators: Actuators that leverage piezoelectric materials to create precise, rapid\nvibrations when subjected to an electric current. These are commonly used in high-\nfidelity haptic systems requiring fine control.\nD\nAdditional Tools Used\nFor preliminary research, I used the PDF scan and summary functionality of ChatGPT11 to sort\nthe papers into relevant clusters and compare the results on a MIRO board12 with my notes and\nthe feedback given by my supervisor. The selected, relevant paper categories were then refined\nmanually and assessed for their correlations and contribution to the thesis after a personal full\nread. As for my writing, I wrote the content of this thesis myself and refined it by integrating\n11https://chat.openai.com/\n12https://miro.com/"}

After finishing my\nwriting phase, instead of using ChatGPT’s capabilities to help me verify my data citations and\ncompleteness of my thesis, I utilized a local Large Language Model (LLM) of Metas ”LLama-\n4”15 in the open-source GitHub project ”LocalGPT”16 to get structural feedback on my thesis\nwriting. Based on the feedback, I simplified my table of contents for the sake of readability,\nclarity, and logical narrative of argumentations, wrote up suggested transitional paragraphs be-\ntween the sections, and corrected grammatical and careless errors in my thesis draft. The choice\nof using a local LLM was made to get continuous feedback on my drafts, and, for the included\nparticipant data, it was crucial to maintain a high level of data protection of the participant’s sen-\nsitive qualitative data presented in the thesis when accessing the logical argumentation structure\nof my discussion and conclusion sections in correlation to the qualitative user data.\nTo preserve anonymity and discretion in photographing the workshop and participants during\ntheir design processes, the image web tool ”Picdefacer”https://picdefacer.com/en/\nwas used to pixelate participants’ faces.\nThe LaTeX markup language platform Overleaf 17 was used to write this thesis, and templates\nfrom the official Overleaf documentation 18 were utilized to include figures and tables in a\ncorrect and structured manner.\n13https://quillbot.com/\n14https://www.grammarly.com/\n15https://github.com/meta-llama/llama3\n16https://github.com/PromtEngineer/localGPT\n17Overleaf: https://www.overleaf.com/\n18Overleaf Documentation: https://www.overleaf.com/learn"}

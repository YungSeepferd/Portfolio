This contextual variability challenges the\ndevelopment of universal haptic communication systems​ [Eid and Al Osman - 2016….]\nWhat is a significant finding about multimodal affective communication according to Christensen (2015)?\n3.\nAnswer: Christensen found that multimodal signals (e.g., combining audio and haptic feedback) are\nmore effective in conveying public emotions like happiness compared to unimodal signals, but private\nemotions like sadness may show less clear interactions with multimodal stimuli​ [Christensen - 2015 -\nEm….]\nWhat are the potential applications of affective haptics in emotional communication highlighted by\nTsetserukou et al. (2009)?\n4.\nAnswer: Applications include enhancing emotional intimacy during online communication through\nsystems like iFeel_IM!, which uses haptic devices (e.g., HaptiHug, HaptiButterfly) to convey emotions\nlike joy, fear, and sadness in real time​ [Tsetserukou et al. - 20….]\nWhat challenges were identified in developing haptic devices for emotional communication as discussed\nby Vyas et al. (2023)?\n5.\nAnswer: Challenges include integrating interdisciplinary approaches, designing scalable and\nadaptable systems for diverse user needs, and addressing ethical concerns like data privacy in\nemotion-sensing technologies [​Vyas et al. - 2023 - A ….]\nWhat are some implications for the future development of affective haptic systems as suggested by\nMacLean (2022)?\n1.\nAnswer: Future systems should prioritize the seamless integration of affective neuroscience with\nhaptic technology, focusing on personalized user experiences and bridging the gap between\ntheoretical knowledge and practical design applications [​MacLean - 2022 - Design….]\nHow does the concept of “pseudo-haptic touch” enhance emotional communication in virtual\nenvironments?\n2.\nAnswer: Pseudo-haptic touch, as implemented in systems like iFeel_IM!, uses haptic feedback\nsynchronized with virtual animations (e.g., hugging in Second Life) to create immersive emotional\nexperiences, enhancing users' perception of physical presence and emotional connection [​\nTsetserukou et al. - 20….]\na.\nWhat future research ambitions are discussed in affective haptics for improving user experience?\n3.\nAnswer: Future ambitions include developing more nuanced and personalized haptic feedback\nsystems, exploring under-researched emotional states like disgust, and integrating AI-driven models\nfor adaptive emotional response [​Eid and Al Osman - 2016…​MacLean - 2022 - Design….]\na.\nHow does the study of multimodal affective stimuli inform the design of haptic systems?\n4.\nAnswer: Insights from multimodal studies, such as those exploring the synergy between auditory and\nhaptic signals, suggest that combining sensory modalities can create more immersive and emotionally\nresonant systems, especially for public emotions​ [Christensen - 2015 - Em…​Eid and Al Osman -\n2016….]\na.\nWhat ethical considerations should guide future research in affective haptics?\n5.\nAnswer: Ethical considerations include ensuring user privacy, obtaining informed consent for emotion\ndata collection, minimizing potential emotional manipulation, and addressing biases in emotional\nrecognition algorithms [​Vyas et al. - 2023 - A …​Eid and Al Osman - 2016….]\na."}

### **Background & Motivation**

**Why Affective Haptics?**

Increasing role of emotionally rich interactions in HCI [6, 7,
12, 29, 11]


**Current trends:**


Haptic UX [9, 4]
Biofeedback & Wearables [1, 26, 14, 2]

XR applications [3]


**Affective haptics -> real-world applications:**

Mental health [11, 30, 26]

Assistive tech [11, 30]



**iFeel_IM!:** sensing the **thermal property** of the object (HaptiTemper), **pressure**

(HaptiHeart, HaptiHug), **vibration** frequency (HaptiButterfly, HaptiTickler, and
HaptiShiver) [27]




**[1]**



**Current Gap:** Frameworks and toolkits not accessible for novice interaction designers to
prototype affective haptic feedback (17, 18, 24)

### **Workshop Procedure**

#### Phase 3: Low-Fidelity On-Body Tandem Prototyping

**Tandem Design Approach:**

**Participants alternate between designer and user roles**

On-body prototyping using Hapticlabs DevKit

Iterative refinement based on real-time feedback

Documenting insights & design improvements


**Challenges:**


**Technical complexity:** Limited actuators and
connectivity issues

**Emotional subjectivity:** Difficulty translating someone
else's emotions and somatic experiences into haptics


**e.g. Participants found that chest**
**actuator placement evoked unintended**
**eerie sensations, highlighting ethical**
**design challenges**




###### 5


### **Findings & Insights**

Questions are abbreviated


###### 6








### **Scientific Criticism & Ethical** **Considerations**



**Scientific Reflection**


**Subjectivity** of emotional responses limits
generalizability

**Small sample size** (6 participants) affects statistical

reliability

**Technical limitations** constrained design exploration
(limited actuators, software usability)

Need for longitudinal studies to assess the toolkits

**impact over time** for building affective haptic prototypes



**Ethical Considerations:** [21, 29, 11]


**Human Touch Sensitivity:** Risk of misinterpretation and
discomfort (context, cultural differences in perception)


**Autonomy, Consent, and User Control:** Always option to
opt-out of an affective haptic experience (modify or disable)


**Consent & Emotional Safety:** Participants' emotional wellbeing during affective haptic interaction (dependency?)


**Data Privacy & Surveillance:** Ethical concerns regarding
personal emotional data and body mapping (biofeedback?)

# **Q&A**

Questions:



1.



**What are the key limitations in affective haptics research as identified by Eid and Al Osman**

**(2016)?**



"How could the toolkit be adapted for

different cultural contexts to ensure

meaningful affective haptic interactions?"


1.What are some implications for the future development of affective haptic systems as suggested by
MacLean (2022)?



Answer: Key limitations include insufficient research on haptic-based affect detection compared to
affect display, limited exploration of emotions like disgust and surprise, and the high contextual
dependency of interpreting haptic stimuli​ [Eid and Al Osman - 2016….]
2.How does the interpretation of haptic stimuli differ based on context, as discussed by Eid and Al Osman
(2016)?

Answer: Haptic stimuli interpretation is highly contextual; emotions like anger or sadness can vary
based on cultural, situational, and individual factors. This contextual variability challenges the
development of universal haptic communication systems​ [Eid and Al Osman - 2016….]
3.What is a significant finding about multimodal affective communication according to Christensen (2015)?

Answer: Christensen found that multimodal signals (e.g., combining audio and haptic feedback) are
more effective in conveying public emotions like happiness compared to unimodal signals, but private
emotions like sadness may show less clear interactions with multimodal stimuli​ [Christensen - 2015 Em….]
4.What are the potential applications of affective haptics in emotional communication highlighted by
Tsetserukou et al. (2009)?

Answer: Applications include enhancing emotional intimacy during online communication through
systems like iFeel_IM!, which uses haptic devices (e.g., HaptiHug, HaptiButterfly) to convey emotions
like joy, fear, and sadness in real time​ [Tsetserukou et al. - 20….]
5.What challenges were identified in developing haptic devices for emotional communication as discussed
by Vyas et al. (2023)?

Answer: Challenges include integrating interdisciplinary approaches, designing scalable and
adaptable systems for diverse user needs, and addressing ethical concerns like data privacy in
emotion-sensing technologies [​Vyas et al. - 2023 - A ….]



Answer: Future systems should prioritize the seamless integration of affective neuroscience with
haptic technology, focusing on personalized user experiences and bridging the gap between
theoretical knowledge and practical design applications [​MacLean - 2022 - Design….]
2.How does the concept of “pseudo-haptic touch” enhance emotional communication in virtual

environments?



a.



Answer: Pseudo-haptic touch, as implemented in systems like iFeel_IM!, uses haptic feedback
synchronized with virtual animations (e.g., hugging in Second Life) to create immersive emotional
experiences, enhancing users' perception of physical presence and emotional connection [​
Tsetserukou et al. - 20….]



3.What future research ambitions are discussed in affective haptics for improving user experience?



a.



Answer: Future ambitions include developing more nuanced and personalized haptic feedback
systems, exploring under-researched emotional states like disgust, and integrating AI-driven models
for adaptive emotional response [​Eid and Al Osman - 2016…​MacLean - 2022 - Design….]



4.How does the study of multimodal affective stimuli inform the design of haptic systems?



a.



Answer: Insights from multimodal studies, such as those exploring the synergy between auditory and
haptic signals, suggest that combining sensory modalities can create more immersive and emotionally
resonant systems, especially for public emotions​ [Christensen - 2015 - Em…​Eid and Al Osman 2016….]



5.What ethical considerations should guide future research in affective haptics?



a.



Answer: Ethical considerations include ensuring user privacy, obtaining informed consent for emotion
data collection, minimizing potential emotional manipulation, and addressing biases in emotional
recognition algorithms [​Vyas et al. - 2023 - A …​Eid and Al Osman - 2016….]

Letter of Recommendation
To Whom it May Concern
I am pleased to provide this letter of recommendation for Vincent Göke, born on March 
25, 1998, in Marburg. Vincent worked as a Product & User Experience intern at 
Algoriddim from February 14, 2022 until April 30, 2022.
Algoriddim, founded in 2006, is a leading software company specializing in music and 
video applications. Our ﬂagship app, “djay”, has been downloaded by over 50 million 
users worldwide and is a winner of multiple Apple Design Awards. Our diverse and 
multi-national team consists of software engineers, musicians, support, marketing and 
social media experts, as well as designers.
Vincent’s key tasks included research in the ﬁeld of music technology and interaction, 
as well as the design and implementation of a prototype which allowed a user to interact 
with and manipulate music in intuitive ways. 
As part of the research, Vincent presented his ﬁndings to core members of our 
international product and engineering teams. His presentations were highly engaging, in 
ﬂuid English, and he managed to break down complex topics into simple terms. His 
expert knowledge in digital audio, as well as music performance and production, 
combined with his understanding of product design and development, proved to be an 
invaluable asset to the team. The slides he created still serve as a reference for a 
comprehensible bird’s eye view of the industry. 
In the further course of his internship, Vincent elaborated on one of the presented digital 
audio manipulation concepts using state-of-the-art product development and UX 
principles. He created personas of potential concept users and provided user ﬂow 
charts to illustrate key functionalities. Based on the analysis and iterative feedback, 
Vincent implemented UI prototypes for tablet devices, reporting directly to our head of 
R&D. To create the wireframes and prototypes, he used state-of-the-art design tools.
Vincent is capable of thinking outside of the box and he demonstrated the ability to 
excel in a highly interdisciplinary, fast paced environment by combining a solid 
academic foundation with profound domain knowledge in music. We were impressed 
with Vincent’s multiple talents.
